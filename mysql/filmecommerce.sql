(11, 'Bill', '', 'Hader', 'M', '<p>William Thomas Hader Jr. was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Sherri Renee (née Patton) and William Thomas Hader. His father owned an air-freight company and worked as a restaurant manager, truck driver and occasional stand-up comedian; his mother was a dance teacher. He has two younger sister, Katie and Kara. His ancestry includes German, Danish, Irish, and English; his surname originates in Germany.</p>\r\n<p>Hader attended Patrick Henry Elementary School, Edison Junior High, and Cascia Hall Preparatory School. He had \"a hard time focusing on class\" and was always \"joking around\". Though he was not hated by classmates, he felt he never truly fit in and filled his time watching movies and reading. He appreciated Monty Python, British comedy, and the films of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, many of which he was introduced to through his father. He made short films with friends and starred in a school production of <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>.</p>\r\n<p>He was unable to gain admission to top film schools because of his \"abysmal\" grades, so he instead enrolled at The Art Institute of Phoenix, and later Scottsdale Community College. Hader has mentioned that his very first job was selling Christmas trees. He also worked as an usher at a movie theater in nearby Tempe, which allowed him to see films for free. He was fired for spoiling the ending of the 1997 film <i>Titanic</i> to noisy patrons. At Scottsdale, he met Nicholas Jasenovec, the director of <i>Paper Heart</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Hader\'s aspirations of becoming a filmmaker eventually led him to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles in 1999. His parents were supportive of his decision to move, and Hader used the money they had originally saved for his college education to cover his living expenses when he arrived in Los Angeles. He found work as a production assistant (PA) while scouring the back pages of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, and he hoped to advance far enough to become an assistant director. He spent much of his young adulthood \"lonely and underemployed,\" filling large amounts of spare time with movie marathons. He regularly worked 18-hour days as a PA, having little time to pursue his creative ambitions. He worked as a PA on the DVD <i>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</i>; the feature films <i>James Dean</i>, <i>Spider-Man</i>, and <i>Collateral Damage</i>; as well as a post-production assistant on VH1 television\'s <i>The Surreal Life</i>. Hader briefly worked as a PA and stage manager on Playboy TV\'s <i>Night Calls</i>; he quit, as he feared it would disappoint his parents. He quit being a PA altogether after a bad experience shooting <i>The Scorpion King</i>.</p>\r\n<p>He subsequently secured a job working as a nighttime assistant editor at post-production facility Triage Entertainment. He invested money into his own short film, but was too embarrassed to release it. Shortly thereafter, Hader and his then-longtime girlfriend broke up. Desperate for a change, he began attending comedy classes with friends at improvisational comedy enterprise the Second City in March 2003. He quickly realized that comedy was the creative outlet that he had needed since he made the decision to leave higher education behind, and soon Hader, his new compatriot in comedy Matt Offerman, and their two friends and fellow humor enthusiasts Eric Filipkowski and Mel Cowan, elected to form their own sketch comedy group. Christening their group <i>Animals from the Future</i>, the four frequently appeared to small audiences at backyard shows in Van Nuys. Matt\'s brother, actor Nick Offerman, told his wife, Megan Mullally, about the group. Mullally, her interest piqued, wanted to see their work personally and, after attending one of the group\'s backyard appearances, she informed Hader of her intention to discuss him, specifically, with Lorne Michaels, creator and executive producer of <i>Saturday Night Live (SNL)</i>. Hader, as a result of Mullally\'s recommendation, was asked to audition for the show, and soon flew to New York to audition for a group of <i>SNL</i> producers. Hader, who would later receive acclaim for his excellent impressions of others while appearing on <i>SNL</i>, had no impressions prepared when he was invited to audition. Despite being nervous and struggling to display his strengths during the audition, this resulted in his spontaneous imitation of an elderly Italian man he had once overheard; this impression would later become the first of Hader\'s many recurring characters on the show: Vinny Vedecci. As a result of the audition, Hader got an agent and manager. Just before he was officially invited to begin work on <i>SNL</i>, Hader was working as an assistant editor on <i>Iron Chef America</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After his film debut <i>You, Me and Dupree</i>, Hader had a wide range of roles such as Katherine Heigl\'s character\'s editor at E! in <i>Knocked Up</i>, the acid-taking mechanic Dave in <i>Hot Rod</i> alongside SNL castmate Andy Samberg, a recumbent biker in <i>The Brothers Solomon</i> (which featured SNL castmate Will Forte in one of the film\'s co-leading roles) and, most famously, as Officer Slater in the Judd Apatow produced Superbad.

Tom Fontana, executive producer of <i>Homicide</i>, cast Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of an injured police officer, after watching Falco\'s performance in <i>Laws of Gravity</i>, a 1992 film directed by Nick Gomez. Fontana said of her, \"She\'s an actress who\'s unadorned by any embroidery. She does everything with such simplicity and honesty, it\'s breathtaking.\" A struggling actress at the time, Falco said her salary from these television episodes paid for one month\'s worth of rent.</p>\r\n<p>Her first big break in films was a small speaking role in the 1994 Woody Allen film <i>Bullets over Broadway</i>. Her friendship with former SUNY Purchase classmate Eric Mendelsohn, who was the assistant to Allen\'s costume designer, Jeffrey Kurland, helped her to be cast in the role. Mendelsohn went on to direct Falco in his feature film <i>Judy Berlin</i>, for which he won Best Director honors at the Sundance Film Festival.

(27, 'Emma', '', 'Stone', 'F', '<p>The recipient of numerous accolades, including an Oscar, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award, she was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2017. Stone has appeared in <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100 in 2013 and 2017, and was featured by <i>Time</i> as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Emily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone (<i>née</i> Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company. Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15. She has a younger brother, Spencer. Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to \"Stone\" when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island. She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.</p>\r\n<p>As an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child. Stone has described herself as having been \"loud\" and \"bossy\" while growing up. She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that \"I made sure I got all As\". Stone suffered panic attacks as a child, which she says caused a decline in her social skills. She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.</p>\r\n<p>Stone started acting at age four; she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage production of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, playing the part of Otter. The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix\'s Valley Youth Theatre-including <i>The Princess and the Pea</i>, </i>Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and <i>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</i>-and performed with the theater\'s improvisational comedy troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon\'s <i>All That</i>. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>Stone attended Xavier College Preparatory?-?an all-girl Catholic high school?-?as a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress. She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled \"Project Hollywood\" (featuring Madonna\'s 2003 song \"Hollywood\") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career. In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalls: \"I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom\", adding, \"I ended up getting none.\" Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes, and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.</p>\r\n<p>When Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, the name \"Emily Stone\" was already taken. She initially chose to go by \"Riley Stone\", but after guest-starring in the NBC drama <i>Medium</i> and the Fox sitcom <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, she decided that she was more comfortable with \"Emma\". She chose to use \"Emma\" in honor of Emma Bunton, aka Baby Spice from the Spice Girls. She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show <i>In Search of the New Partridge Family</i> (2004). The resulting show, retitled <i>The New Partridge Family</i> (2004), remained an unsold pilot. She followed this with a guest appearance in Louis C.K.\'s HBO series <i>Lucky Louie</i>. She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama <i>Heroes</i> (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her \"rock bottom\" experience. In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama <i>Drive</i>, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.</p>\r\n<p>Stone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola\'s comedy <i>Superbad</i> (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill\'s romantic interest, she dyed her hair red. A reviewer for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> found her \"appealing\", but felt that her role was poorly written. Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as \"amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I\'ve had since then\". The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.</p>\r\n<p>The following year, Stone starred in the comedy <i>The Rocker</i> (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the \"straight face\" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as \"a big smiler and laugher\", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy <i>The House Bunny</i>, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses\' 1982 song \"I Know What Boys Like\". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and <i>TV Guide</i>\'s Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: \"She\'s positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her.\"</p>\r\n<p>Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters\' <i>Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</i>. Loosely based on Charles Dickens\' 1843 novella <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success. Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer\'s $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film <i>Zombieland</i>, in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which <i>Empire</i>\'s Chris Hewitt found to be \"somewhat underwritten\". In a more positive review, the critic for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> wrote: \"[T]he hugely promising Stone ... [is] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years.\" Stone\'s final release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney\'s <i>Paper Man</i>, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.</p>\r\n<p>Stone provided the voice of an Australian Shepherd in <i>Marmaduke</i> (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey, which is based on Brad Anderson\'s long-running comic strip of the same name. Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in <i>Easy A</i>, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck. Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne\'s 1850 historical romance novel <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script \"so different and unique from anything I\'d read before\", saying that it was \"funny and sweet\". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition. The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone\'s performance was considered its prime asset. Anna Smith of <i>Time Out</i> commented: \"Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth.\" With a total box office of $75 million, the film was a commercial success. Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC\'s late-night sketch comedy <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan. Stone described it as \"the greatest week of my life\". She hosted it again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015. A brief appearance in the sex comedy <i>Friends with Benefits</i> (2011) reunited her with Gluck. She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa\'s romantic comedy <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i> (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film features her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling\'s character. Despite finding \"some inevitable collapses into convention\" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone \"ties the whole film together\". At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress - Comedy award for her performance in the film. <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i> was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide with a production budget of $50 million.</p>\r\n<p>Disillusioned at being typecast as the \"sarcastic interest of the guy\", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor\'s period drama <i>The Help</i> (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett\'s 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: \"Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, \'God! God! This is Skeeter.\" She was cast as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, <i>The Help</i> became Stone\'s most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for <i>Empire</i>, Anna Smith thought that Stone was \"well-meaning and hugely likable\" despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.</p>\r\n<p>Stone declined a role in the action comedy film <i>21 Jump Street</i> after signing on to Marc Webb\'s 2012 film <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>, a reboot of Sam Raimi\'s <i>Spider-Man</i> series. She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the title character (played by Andrew Garfield). Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously. She told <i>The Vancouver Sun</i> that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\", adding that she was only familiar with Stacy\'s character from Bryce Dallas Howard\'s portrayal in <i>Spider-Man 3</i>. <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012 with global revenues of $757.9 million. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>\'s Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone \"irresistible\", and Ian Freer of <i>Empire</i> magazine was particularly impressed with Stone\'s and Garfield\'s performances. At the annual People\'s Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress. Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, <i>Sleeping Dogs</i>, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.</p>\r\n<p>Stone began 2013 with a voice role in DreamWorks\' <i>The Croods</i>, an animated feature nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. This followed with an appearance in <i>Movie 43</i>, an anthology film which consists of sixteen short stories-she played the title role in the segment entitled \"Veronica\". The actress collaborated with Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer\'s <i>Gangster Squad</i> (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s. <i>The New York Times</i>\' A. O. Scott dismissed the film as \"a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits\", but praised her pairing with Gosling. Stone expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>. In an interview with <i>Total Film</i>, the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film\'s protagonist. \"She saves him more than he saves her. She\'s incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He\'s the muscle, she\'s the brains.\" Her performance was well received by critics; an <i>Empire</i> reviewer praised her for standing out in the film: \"Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character.\" The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids\' Choice Awards. Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen\'s romantic comedy <i>Magic in the Moonlight</i>, a modest commercial success. A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as \"the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect\".</p>\r\n<p>The black comedy-drama <i>Birdman</i>, from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone\'s final film release in 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film features her in the role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter. <i>Birdman</i> was critically acclaimed, and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture. The Movie Network considered it one of Stone\'s best performances to date and Robbie Collin of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was \"like a knitting needle to the gut\". She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an Academy, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics\' Choice Movie award for Best Supporting Actress.</p>\r\n<p>From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical <i>Cabaret</i> as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams. Considering it to be \"the most nerve-racking thing ever\", Stone told the <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role. <i>Variety</i>\'s Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance \"a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy.\" Both of Stone\'s 2015 films?-?the romantic comedy-drama <i>Aloha</i>, and the mystery drama <i>Irrational Man?</i>-?were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics. In Cameron Crowe\'s <i>Aloha</i>, she took on the role of an air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in the Woody Allen-directed <i>Irrational Man</i>, she portrayed the romantic interest of Joaquin Phoenix\'s character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast, as Stone\'s character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood. Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress - Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. Stone would also in 2015 star in the music video for Win Butler\'s single \"Anna\"</p>\r\n<p>During her <i>Cabaret</i> show, Stone met director Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama <i>La La Land</i>. The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, featured Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles. Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i> and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. For the musical\'s soundtrack, she recorded six songs. <i>La La Land</i> served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and received highly positive reviews. Besides being Stone\'s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget. Writing for <i>The Guardian</i>, Peter Bradshaw reviewed, \"Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears.\" Stone received an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe and a SAG Award for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Stone\'s sole film release of 2017 was the sports drama <i>Battle of the Sexes</i>, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, trained with a dialect coach to speak in King\'s accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg). The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone\'s performance to be the best of her career. Benjamin Lee of <i>The Guardian</i> praised her for playing against type, and credited her for being \"strong\" and \"convincing\" in the part. Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget. Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Stone and Rachel Weisz starred as Abigail Masham and Sarah Churchill, two cousins fighting for the affection of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), in Yorgos Lanthimos\'s historical comedy-drama <i>The Favourite</i>. Stone found it challenging being an American among a British cast, and had difficulty in mastering the accent. The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August. Michael Nordine of IndieWire praised Stone for taking on a bold role after <i>La La Land</i>, and termed the three leading ladies \"a majestic triumvirate in a period piece that\'s as tragic as it is hilarious.\" For <i>The Favourite</i>, Stone received her fifth Golden Globe nomination and third Oscar nomination. That September, she featured in and served as an executive producer for the Netflix dark comedy miniseries <i>Maniac</i>, co-starring Jonah Hill and directed by Cary Fukunaga. Stone and Hill played two strangers, Annie Landsberg and Owen Milgrim, whose lives are transformed due to a mysterious pharmaceutical trial. An admirer of Fukunaga\'s work, Stone agreed to the project without reading the script. Lucy Mangan of <i>The Guardian</i> praised Stone and Hill for playing against type and for delivering career-best performances; Judy Berman of <i>Time</i> was similarly impressed with their growth as actors since <i>Superbad</i> and took note of the complexity in their performances. In the same year, Stone appeared alongside Paul McCartney in a music video for his song \"Who Cares\".</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Stone will next star in <i>Zombieland: Double Tap</i>, in the drama <i>Love May Fail</i>, based on Matthew Quick\'s 2015 novel, and in a live-action spin-off of <i>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</i> titled <i>Cruella</i>, directed by Craig Gillespie, in which she will portray Cruella de Vil (originally played by Glenn Close in the 1996 live-action adaptation).

Her adoptive mother was a nurse and receptionist while her adoptive father was a Disciples of Christ pastor; both were originally from Canada. McDormand has said that her biological mother, to whom she proudly referred, along with herself, as \"white trash,\" may have been one of the parishioners at Vernon\'s church. She has a sister, Dorothy A. \"Dot\" McDormand, who is an ordained Disciples of Christ minister and chaplain, as well as another sibling, both of whom were adopted by the McDormands, who had no biological children.</p>\r\n<p>Because her father specialized in restoring congregations, he frequently moved their family, and they lived in several small towns in Illinois, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, before settling in Monessen, Pennsylvania, where McDormand graduated from Monessen High School in 1975.

And since she is the film\'s sole voice of morality, it\'s right that she is so memorable.\" In 1996, she won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as a pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson in <i>Fargo</i>, written and directed by the Coen brothers. Writing for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, Roger Ebert called <i>Fargo</i> \"one of the best films I\'ve ever seen\" and felt that McDormand \"should have a lock on an Academy Award nomination with this performance, which is true in every individual moment, and yet slyly, quietly, over the top in its cumulative effect.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 2000, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her portrayal of an overbearing mother in <i>Almost Famous</i>.

Winkler has a sister named Beatrice.</p>\r\n<p>Winkler has said that he was very anxious as a child because of his undiagnosed dyslexia, and that he was considered to be \"slow, stupid, not living up to my potential\". He also said that his relationship with his parents was strained, due at least partially to their attitude towards his undiagnosed dyslexia. As his father spoke 11 languages and could do math in his head, he did not understand Winkler\'s problems at school, and why Winkler would celebrate a C grade. His father often said to him in German \"Du bist ein dummer Hund\", which means \"you are a dumb dog\" and often punished him for his difficulties in school.

She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and her mother brought her up to be \"tough\" like them. Karen did not allow her daughter to play with other girls in preschool as she deemed her \"too rough\" with them. Lawrence was educated at the Kammerer Middle School in Louisville. She did not enjoy her childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety and considered herself a misfit among her peers. Lawrence has said that her anxieties vanished when she performed on stage and that acting gave her a sense of accomplishment.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence\'s school activities included cheerleading, softball, field hockey and basketball, which she played on a boys\' team that was coached by her father.

When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. She had her first acting assignment at age nine when she played the role of a prostitute in a church play that was based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence was fourteen and on a family vacation in New York City when she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for talent agents.

After Lawrence\'s first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence\'s mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult because she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. While her mother encouraged her to go into modelling, Lawrence insisted on pursuing acting. At that time, she considered acting to be a natural fit for her abilities, and she turned down several offers for modeling assignments. Lawrence dropped out of school at age 14 without receiving a GED or a diploma. She has said that she was \"self-educated\" and that her career was her priority.

Mark Feeney for <i>The Boston Globe</i> thought of Lawrence\'s performance as \"a thankless task\", but Derek Elley from <i>Variety</i> praised her as the production\'s prime asset, writing that she \"plumbs fresher depths\" into the film. Her performance earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Emerging Actress at the Venice Film Festival. Also that year, she appeared in the music video for the song \"The Mess I Made\" by Parachute. The following year, she starred in Lori Petty\'s drama <i>The Poker House</i> as the oldest of three sisters living with a drug-abusing mother. Stephen Farber of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> thought that Lawrence \"has a touching poise on camera that conveys the resilience of children\", and her role in <i>The Poker House</i> won an Outstanding Performance award from the Los Angeles Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence\'s breakthrough role came in the small-scale drama <i>Winter\'s Bone</i> (2010), based on Daniel Woodrell\'s novel of the same name. In Debra Granik\'s independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began to live with the family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood. David Denby of <i>The New Yorker</i> said the film \"would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic\", and Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote that \"her performance is more than acting, it\'s a gathering storm. Lawrence\'s eyes are a roadmap to what\'s tearing Ree apart.\" The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The actress was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance, and with her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, she became the second youngest person to be nominated in the category.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Lawrence took on a supporting role in <i>Like Crazy</i>, a romantic drama about long-distance relationships, starring Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones. Kenneth Turan of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> considered the film to be an \"intensely wrought and immensely satisfying love story\" and credited all three performers for \"making their [characters\'] yearning palpable\". She then appeared in Jodie Foster\'s black comedy <i>The Beaver</i> alongside Foster and Mel Gibson. Filmed in 2009, the production was delayed due to controversy concerning Gibson, and earned less than half of its $21 million budget.</p>\r\n<p>After her dramatic role in <i>Winter\'s Bone</i>, Lawrence looked for something less serious, and found it with her first high-profile release-Matthew Vaughn\'s superhero film <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011)-a prequel to the <i>X-Men</i> film series. She portrayed the shapeshifting mutant Mystique, a role played by Rebecca Romijn in the earlier films. Vaughn cast Lawrence, as he thought that she would be able to portray the weakness and strength involved in the character\'s transformation. For the part, Lawrence lost weight and practiced yoga. For Mystique\'s blue form, she had to undergo eight hours of makeup, as Romijn had done on the other films. She was intimidated in the role as she admired Romijn. Writing for <i>USA Today</i>, Claudia Puig considered the film to be a \"classy re-boot\" of the film series, and believed that her \"high-spirited performance\" empowered the film. With worldwide earnings of $350 million, <i>X-Men: First Class</i> became Lawrence\'s highest-grossing film at that point.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012 she played Katniss Everdeen in <i>The Hunger Games</i>, an adaptation of the first book in author Suzanne Collins\' <i>Hunger Games</i> trilogy. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the series tells the story of the teenage heroine Everdeen as she joins rebel forces against a totalitarian government after winning a brutal televised annual event. Despite being an admirer of the books, Lawrence was initially hesitant to accept the part, because of the grand scale of the film. She agreed to the project after her mother convinced her to take the part. She practiced yoga, archery, rock and tree climbing, and hand-to-hand combat techniques for the role. While training for the part, she injured herself running into a wall. The film received generally positive reviews, and Lawrence\'s portrayal of Everdeen was particularly praised. Todd McCarthy of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> called her an \"ideal screen actress\", adding that she embodies the Everdeen of the novel, and believed that she anchored the film \"with impressive gravity and presence\". Roger Ebert agreed that she was \"strong and convincing in the central role\". With worldwide revenues of over $690 million, <i>The Hunger Games</i> became a top-grossing film featuring a female lead, making Lawrence the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. The success of the film established her as a star.</p>\r\n<p>Later in 2012, Lawrence played a young depressed widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell\'s romance movie <i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>. The film was an adaptation of Matthew Quick\'s novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was drawn to her character\'s complex personality: \"She didn\'t really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn\'t\". While Russell initially considered Lawrence to be too young for the part, she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. The actress found herself challenged by Russell\'s spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the \"best experience of my life\". Richard Corliss of <i>Time</i> wrote: \"Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who <i>is</i>, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role.\" Peter Travers believed that Lawrence \"is some kind of miracle. She\'s rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes all in the same scene, even in the same breath.\" She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, becoming-at age 22-the second youngest Best Actress winner. Her final film of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai\'s critically panned thriller <i>House at the End of the Street</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2013, Lawrence hosted an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, with musical guest The Lumineers. <i>The Devil You Know</i>, a small-scale production that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, was her first release of 2013. She then reprised the role of Everdeen in <i>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</i>, the second installment in the <i>Hunger Games</i> film series. While performing the film\'s underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection that resulted in a brief loss of hearing. With box office earnings of $865 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release. Stephanie Zacharek of <i>The Village Voice</i> believed that Lawrence\'s portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal role model, and wrote that \"there\'s no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her\". She took on a supporting role in Russell\'s ensemble crime drama <i>American Hustle</i> (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by Christian Bale). Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\'s Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen. Geoffrey Macnab of <i>The Independent</i> praised her as \"funny and acerbic\", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband\'s mistress (played by Amy Adams) on the lips. Lawrence\'s performance won her the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third Academy Award nomination, her first in the supporting category.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence played Serena Pemberton in Susanne Bier\'s depression-era drama <i>Serena</i> (2014), based on the novel of the same name by Ron Rash. In the film, she and her husband George (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) are a married couple who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The project was filmed in 2012, and was released in 2014 to poor reviews. Lawrence then reprised the role of Mystique in <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i>, which served as a sequel to both <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> (2006) and <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011). The film received positive reviews and grossed $748.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series to that point. Justin Chang of Variety praised her look in the film but thought that she had little to do but \"glower, snarl and let the f/x artists do their thing\". Lawrence\'s next two releases were in the final parts of <i>The Hunger Games</i> film series, <i>Mockingjay - Part 1</i> (2014) and <i>Part 2</i> (2015). For the musical score of the former film, she sang the song \"The Hanging Tree\", which charted on multiple international singles charts. In a review of the final film in the series, Manohla Dargis of <i>The New York Times</i> drew similarities between her rise to stardom and Everdeen\'s journey as a rebel leader, writing: \"Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing, partly because, like all great stars, she seems to be playing a version of her \'real\' self\". Both films earned more than $650 million worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence worked with Russell for the third time in the biopic <i>Joy</i> (2015), in which she plays the eponymous character, a troubled single mother who becomes a successful businessperson after inventing the Miracle Mop. During production in Boston, the press reported on a disagreement between Russell and Lawrence that resulted in a \"screaming match\". She said that her friendship with Russell made it easier for them to disagree, because people fight when they really love each other. The film was not as well received as their previous collaborations, but her performance was praised. Richard Roeper called it \"a wonderfully layered performance that carries the film through its rough spots and sometime dubious detours\" that was her best since <i>Winter\'s Bone</i>. She won a third Golden Globe Award, and was nominated for another Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the youngest person to accrue four Oscar nominations. Lawrence began 2016 by providing the narration for <i>A Beautiful Planet</i>, a documentary film that explores Earth from the International Space Station. She played Mystique for the third time in <i>X-Men: Apocalypse</i> (2016). The film received mixed reviews, with a consensus that it was overfilled with action that detracted from the story\'s themes and cast\'s performances. Helen O\'Hara from <i>Empire</i> considered the film to be a letdown from the previous installments of the series, and criticized the actress for making her character too grim. Despite this, she was rewarded Favorite Movie Actress at the 43rd People\'s Choice Awards.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence was paid $20 million for playing Aurora Lane in the science fiction film <i>Passengers</i> (2016), and she received top-billing over co-star Chris Pratt. It features Pratt and her as two people who wake up 90 years too soon from an induced hibernation on a spaceship bound for a new planet. Lawrence says that she felt nervous performing her first sex scene and kissing a married man (Pratt) on screen; she drank alcohol to prepare herself for filming. Critical reaction was mixed, but Lawrence defended the film by calling it a \"tainted, complicated love story\". Darren Aronofsky\'s psychological horror film <i>Mother!</i> was Lawrence\'s sole release of 2017. She starred as a young wife who experiences trauma when her home is invaded by unexpected guests. Lawrence spent three months rehearsing the film in a warehouse in Brooklyn, despite her reluctance to rehearsals in her previous assignments. The intense role proved difficult for her to film; she was put on supplemental oxygen when she hyperventilated one day, and she also dislocated a rib. <i>Mother!</i> polarized viewers and prompted mass walkouts. The film was better received by critics; Walter Addiego of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> labelled it \"assaultive\" and a \"deliberate test of audience endurance\", and credited Lawrence for \"never allow[ing] herself to be reduced simply to a howling victim\".</p>\r\n<p>The following year, Lawrence starred as Dominika Egorova, a Russian spy who makes contact with a mysterious CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton), in Francis Lawrence\'s espionage thriller <i>Red Sparrow</i>, based on Jason Matthews\' novel of the same name. She learned to speak in a Russian accent and undertook ballet training for four months. Lawrence was challenged by the sexuality in her role, but has said that performing the nude scenes made her feel empowered. IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn disliked the film\'s denouement, but praised the work of Lawrence and Charlotte Rampling, stating that \"the considerable talent on display is [the film\'s] constant saving grace.\" As of 2018, Lawrence\'s films have grossed over $5.7 billion worldwide.</p>', 'actors/jennifer-lawrence_Cover.jpg'),
(35, 'Jessica', '', 'Lange', 'F', '<p>The thirteenth actress in history to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting, winning two Academy Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, one Tony Award, one Screen Actors Guild Award and five Golden Globe Awards. Additionally, she is the second actress in history to win the Academy Award for Best Actress after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; the third actress and first performer since 1943 to receive two Oscar nominations within the same year; the fifth actress and ninth performer to win Oscars in both the lead and supporting acting categories; and is tied as the sixth most Oscar-nominated actress in history. She is the only performer ever to win Primetime Emmy Awards in both the supporting and lead acting categories for the same miniseries. Lange has also garnered one Critics Choice Award and three Dorian Awards, making her the most honored actress by the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association. In 1998, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> listed Lange among the 25 Greatest Actresses of the 1990s. In 2014, Lange was scheduled to receive a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it.</p>\r\n<p>Jessica Phyllis Lange was born in Cloquet, Minnesota, on April 20, 1949. Her father, Albert John Lange (1913-1989), was a teacher and traveling salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (née Sahlman; 1913-1998), was a housewife. Third of four children, she has two older sisters, Jane and Ann, and a younger brother named George. Her paternal ancestry originates in Germany and the Netherlands, while her maternal ancestry originates in Finland. Due to the nature of her father\'s professions, her family moved over a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling back down in her hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.</p>\r\n<p>In 1967, she received a scholarship to study art and photography at the University of Minnesota, where she met and began dating Spanish photographer Paco Grande. After the two married in 1971, Lange left college to pursue a more bohemian lifestyle, traveling in the United States and Mexico in a minivan with Grande. The couple then moved to Paris, where they drifted apart. While in Paris, Lange studied mime theatre under the supervision of Étienne Decroux, and joined the Opéra-Comique as a dancer. She later studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>While sharing an apartment with Jerry Hall and Grace Jones, she was discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and subsequently became a model for the Wilhelmina modelling agency. In 1973, she returned to the States and began work in New York City as a waitress at the Lion\'s Head Tavern in Greenwich Village. While modelling, Lange was discovered by Hollywood producer Dino De Laurentiis, who was looking to cast his next leading lady, an ingenue for his remake of the 1933 <i>King Kong</i>. Despite being a box-office success - it became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 - and receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the film and her performance were widely panned. However, renowned film critic Pauline Kael praised her, noting, \"The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange\'s fast yet dreamy comic style. [She] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in <i>My Man Godfrey</i>, [and] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they\'re in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like her, the way people liked Lombard.\" Lange went on to win the 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She remained a favorite of Kael, who later wrote \"She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too.\"</p>\r\n<p>At the close of the decade, Bob Fosse, whom Lange had befriended and with whom she had carried on a casual romantic affair, cast Lange as the Angel of Death, a part that he had written specifically for her in his semiautobiographical film, <i>All That Jazz</i> (1979). She had also been considered for the role of Wendy Torrance in <i>The Shining</i> before that role ultimately went to Shelley Duvall.</p>\r\n<p>Lange began the new decade in the light romp <i>How to Beat the High Cost of Living</i> (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it received mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which he was working with Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for <i>Goin\' South</i> (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic <i>film noir</i>, <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i> (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.</p>\r\n<p>While editing <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, Graeme Clifford realized he had found the leading lady for his next film - his first as a director; a biographical film of actress Frances Farmer, whose disillusionment with Hollywood and chaotic family background led her down a tragic path. Filming <i>Frances</i> (1982), which co-starred Kim Stanley and Sam Shepard, was a grueling experience for Lange, who pored over the screenplay scene by scene, making deep and often taxing connections between her life and Farmer\'s to tap into the well of emotions the role required. By the end of the shoot, she was physically and mentally spent. Due to this, she decided to take her co-star Stanley\'s advice to star in \"something light\", which led her to accept a supporting role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack\'s <i>Tootsie</i> (1982).</p>\r\n<p>In 1982, Lange became the first performer in 40 years to receive two Academy Award nominations in the same year, scoring a nomination for her work in <i>Frances</i> and eventually winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in <i>Tootsie</i>, which not only became the second-highest-grossing film of 1982, following Steven Spielberg\'s <i>ET</i>, but which also scored an additional nine Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture. Her performance in the film also earned her a Golden Globe, along with awards from the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Lange also won Best Actress at the Moscow International Film Festival for her performance in <i>Frances</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Lange next produced and starred, again opposite Shepard, in 1984\'s <i>Country</i>, a topical film depicting a family during the farm crisis. Her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. That same year, she made her television debut as Maggie the Cat, starring opposite Tommy Lee Jones in a CBS <i>Playhouse</i> production of Tennessee Williams\'s <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>. The following year, she testified before the United States Congress on behalf of the Democratic House Task Force on Agriculture, alongside Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, whom she later neighbored and befriended.</p>\r\n<p>At the close of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz\'s biopic, <i>Sweet Dreams</i>, opposite Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second place for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In several interviews, Meryl Streep has stated that she \"begged\" Reisz, who directed her in 1981\'s <i>The French Lieutenant\'s Woman</i>, for the role of Cline, but that his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has also been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange\'s performance, calling her \"beyond wonderful\" in the film and stating, \"I couldn\'t imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did because she was so amazing in it.\" In 2018, Streep further commented, \"Jessica did it better than any human being could possibly have done it.\" Streep has also admitted, \"Every job I\'ve ever taken, about three weeks before I begin, I call up my agent and say, \'I don\'t think I can do this. I don\'t think I\'m right for it. They should call up Jessica Lange.\'\"</p>\r\n<p>Lange\'s films throughout the mid- to late 1980s, which included <i>Crimes of the Heart</i> (1986), <i>Far North</i> (1988), and <i>Everybody\'s All-American</i> (1989). In 1989, she starred in Costa-Gavras\' <i>Music Box</i> Lange played a Hungarian lawyer defending her father of Nazi war crimes. Her performance earned her a fifth Academy Award nomination and a sixth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Lange continued making films throughout the 1990s, periodically taking time off to raise her children and also choosing theater- and television-based projects. She began the decade in Paul Brickman\'s warmly received <i>Men Don\'t Leave</i> (1990), for which she earned positive reviews and came in third place for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. She was then approached by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who had both auditioned her for the role of Jake LaMotta\'s wife in <i>Raging Bull</i> (1981), to star in a remake of <i>Cape Fear</i> (1991). The film became the 12th-highest-grossing film of the year. In 1992, Lange once again starred opposite Robert De Niro in Irwin Winkler\'s <i>Night and the City</i> and also starred in a television adaptation of Willa Cather\'s <i>O Pioneers!</i>, receiving her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>In 1994, Lange was lauded for her performance as a manic depressive army wife in the 1960s in Tony Richardson\'s final film, <i>Blue Sky</i>. In 1995, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the Utah Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Actress. She also came in second place for the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. She became the second actress in history, after Meryl Streep, to follow up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar win with a Best Actress Oscar win, an achievement not repeated until nearly twenty years later by Cate Blanchett.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995, she followed her victory with further critically lauded performances in <i>Losing Isaiah</i>, opposite Halle Berry, and <i>Rob Roy</i>, with Liam Neeson. That same year, Lange reprised her role as Blanche DuBois in a CBS television adaptation of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, opposite Alec Baldwin, Diane Lane, and John Goodman. She received glowing reviews for her performance, which earned her fourth Golden Globe Award and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.</p>\r\n<p>In 1996, Lange made her London stage debut in another performance as Blanche DuBois, which received rave reviews. The following year, she starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a film adaptation of Jane Smiley\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, <i>A Thousand Acres</i>. Lange received her ninth Golden Globe Award nomination and won the Venice Film Festival\'s Schermi d\'Amore award for her performance in the film. In 1998, she starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in a film adaptation of Balzac\'s <i>Cousin Bette</i>, for which she received strong reviews. That same year, Lange also starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in the somewhat cult classic, <i>Hush</i>, which generally received negative reviews. Roger Ebert, however, praised Lange\'s performance, commenting, \"The film\'s most intriguing element is the performance by Jessica Lange, who by not going over the top provides Martha with a little pathos to leaven the psychopathology.\"</p>\r\n<p>Lange received strong reviews for her performance in <i>Titus</i>, Julie Taymor\'s 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare\'s <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. Film critic for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Lisa Schwarzbaum, included Lange in a \"for your consideration\" article directed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She commented, \"Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words \'Academy Awards\' should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in <i>Titus</i> as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare for the first time as if nothing could be more fun, Lange steals the show - and when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that\'s grand theft.\"</p>\r\n<p>She appeared mostly in supporting roles thereafter, most notably opposite Christina Ricci in the 2001 adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel\'s best-selling memoir on depression, <i>Prozac Nation</i>. In 2003, Lange starred opposite Tom Wilkinson in HBO\'s <i>Normal</i>, a film about a man who reveals to his wife his decision to have a sex change, for which she received nominations for the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She followed this with performances in the Bob Dylan vehicle, <i>Masked and Anonymous</i> (2003), Tim Burton\'s <i>Big Fish</i> (2003), Jim Jarmusch\'s <i>Broken Flowers</i> (2005) and Wim Wenders\' <i>Don\'t Come Knocking</i> (2005). She later starred with Tammy Blanchard in a remake of <i>Sybil</i> in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Lange co-starred as Big Edie, opposite Drew Barrymore, in HBO\'s <i>Grey Gardens</i>, directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The film was a huge success, garnering 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and winning five. Lange won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie after two previous nominations in the same category. She also received her eleventh Golden Globe Award nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance, losing both awards to Barrymore.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Lange joined the cast of FX\'s horror anthology series <i>American Horror Story</i>. Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk originally wrote her part as a supporting character, but after Lange acquired the role, they expanded it considerably. Murphy, a long-time admirer of Lange, stated that he chose her because he wanted to expose her work to a new generation of viewers. He also singled out her performance as Blanche DuBois on Broadway in 1992, which he saw twice, as his favorite performance, citing it as another motivating factor in hiring Lange. The show was a huge success not only for the network and creators, but also for Lange, who experienced a resurgence in her popularity, receiving rave reviews and several awards for her controversial role. She was chosen by <i>TV Guide</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, and <i>MTV</i> for giving one of the \"best performances of 2011\". In addition, she won a second Primetime Emmy Award, a fifth Golden Globe Award, and her first Screen Actors Guild Award, after two previous nominations. She was also awarded a Special Achievement Satellite Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series by the International Press Academy and the Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the <i>Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association</i> (GALECA). She was further nominated for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics\' Choice Television Award, and Saturn Award.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, she had a supporting role in her <i>Grey Gardens</i> director Michael Suscy\'s box-office hit <i>The Vow</i>, opposite Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, but also returned to star as the lead in the second season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, titled <i>American Horror Story: Asylum</i>. Once again, she was chosen by <i>TV Guide</i> and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> for giving one of the \"best performances of 2012\". She won a second Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the GALECA, and received a fifth Emmy nomination, a thirteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a second Saturn Award nomination, and a second Critics\' Choice Television Award nomination.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, the third season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>, garnered the series its highest ratings to that point, and has held the record for garnering the series its highest on-average ratings. Lange was joined by fellow film actors Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. For her work on the show, Lange earned a third Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries, a third Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year and her first Critic\'s Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. She also received her fourteenth Golden Globe nomination, her fifth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and her fifth Satellite Award nomination for her performance on the series. In addition, Lange replaced Glenn Close in a film adaptation of Émile Zola\'s <i>Thérèse Raquin</i>, directed by Charlie Stratton and titled <i>In Secret</i>, co-starring Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Felton, Oscar Isaac, and Matt Lucas for which she received rave reviews.</p>\r\n<p>Lange began 2014 by being honored with a nomination for a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it. Lange was also recognized by <i>Elle Magazine</i> with the L\'Oreal de Paris Legend Award presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during <i>The Women in Hollywood Awards</i>, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing. She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>Later in the year, Marc Jacobs chose Lange to be the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. In addition, Lange was featured in the brand\'s summer and fall print ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and starred in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs. Previously, Jacobs dressed and interviewed Lange for <i>Love</i> magazine\'s fifth-anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as the soundtrack for his autumn/winter 2014 show. She next starred opposite Mark Wahlberg in the remake of the 1970s action-thriller, <i>The Gambler</i>, receiving rave reviews for her work. She also led the fourth season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, titled <i>American Horror Story: Freak Show</i>. The series, once again, topped its and the network\'s highest ratings, breaking all ratings records for both. Though self-admittedly not a singer, Lange\'s covers of David Bowie\'s \"Life on Mars\" and Lana Del Rey\'s \"Gods and Monsters\" for the show were both hugely popular, receiving heavy circulation on YouTube and charting in the top 50 on the iTunes music charts. For her work on the show, Lange received her seventh Primetime Emmy Award nomination, her fifteenth Golden Globe nomination, and her fourth Critics\' Choice Television Award nomination.

(36, 'Jim', '', 'Parsons', 'M', '<p>Known for playing Sheldon Cooper in the CBS sitcom <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. He has received several awards for his performance, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy.</p>\r\n<p>James Joseph Parsons was born at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas, and was raised in one of its northern suburbs, Spring. He is the son of Milton Joseph \"Mickey/Jack\" Parsons, Jr. and teacher Judy Ann (née McKnight). His sister Julie Ann Parsons is also a teacher. After playing the role of the Kola-Kola bird in a school production of <i>The Elephant\'s Child</i> at age six, Parsons was determined to become an actor. He attended Klein Oak High School in Spring. Parsons points to a role in <i>Noises Off</i> during his junior year as the first time \"I fully connected with the role I was playing and started to truly understand what it meant to be honest on stage.\" The young Parsons was heavily influenced by sitcoms, particularly <i>Three\'s Company</i>, <i>Family Ties</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After graduating from high school, Parsons received a bachelor\'s degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was a founding member of Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, \"Jim is a very specific personality. He\'s thoroughly original, which is one reason he\'s been so successful. But we worried, \'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we\'re doing?\' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out.\" Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: \"school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things.\" Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons traced his family\'s history on TLC\'s <i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i> in September 2013 and discovered French heritage from his father\'s side. One of his ancestors was the French architect Louis-François Trouard (1729-1804).</p>\r\n<p>In New York, Parsons worked in Off-Broadway productions and made several television appearances. In a much-discussed 2003 Quiznos commercial, Parsons played a man who had been raised by wolves and continued to nurse from his wolf \"mother\". He had a recurring role on the television show <i>Judging Amy</i> and appeared on the television series <i>Ed</i>. Parsons also had minor roles in several movies, including <i>Garden State</i> and <i>School for Scoundrels</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons has estimated that he auditioned for between 15 and 30 television pilots, but on many of the occasions when he was cast, the show failed to find a television network willing to purchase it. The exception came with <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers \"brilliantly use those words that most of us don\'t recognize to create that rhythm. And the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue, and in a lot of ways still is.\"</p>\r\n<p>In his audition, Mr. Parsons so impressed series creator Chuck Lorre that Lorre insisted on a second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends and the waitress who lives across the hall. The role requires Parsons to \"rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows.\" Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon\'s lines.</p>\r\n<p>Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons\'s physical comedy to that of Buster Keaton and other silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons\' instincts, saying that \"You can\'t teach that.\" Lorre describes Parsons\' \"great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as \'inspired\'.\" Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons\' performance as \"so spot-on, it seems as if the character and the actor are the same person.\" Parsons admits that the work is \"more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take. And that\'s really the fun of it.\"</p>\r\n<p>In August 2009, Parsons won the Television Critics Association award for individual achievement in comedy, beating Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Steve Carell, and Neil Patrick Harris. Parsons was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, winning in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014. In September 2010, Parsons and co-stars Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco signed new contracts, guaranteeing each of them $200,000 per episode for the fourth season of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, with substantial raises for each of the next three seasons. The three were also promised a percentage of the show\'s earnings. In January 2011, Parsons won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series - Comedy (the award was presented by co-star Cuoco). From August 2013, Parsons, Cuoco and Galecki each earned $325,000 per episode. In August 2014, Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco once again signed new contracts, guaranteeing each of them $1,000,000 per episode for the eighth, ninth, and tenth seasons of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, as well as quadrupling their percentage of the show\'s earnings to over 1% each.</p>\r\n<p>In August 2018, Parsons announced his refusal of a contract worth $50 million for seasons 13 and 14. The producers simultaneously announced that, after 279 episodes, the most of any multi-camera series in TV history, the show will come to an \"epic, creative close\" in May 2019. Parsons is expected to remain in his role as narrator of the prequel series, <i>Young Sheldon</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Parsons appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Steve Martin, and Rashida Jones in the comedy film <i>The Big Year</i>. It was released in October. That same year, he appeared as the human alter ego of Walter, the newest Muppet introduced in <i>The Muppets</i>. On May 18, 2012, Parsons began appearing on Broadway as Elwood P. Dowd in a revival of <i>Harvey</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 11, 2015. He voiced Oh, one of the lead roles in the DreamWorks Animation comedy film <i>Home</i> (2015), alongside Rihanna. On January 29, 2015, it was announced that Parsons would star as God in the Broadway production of <i>An Act of God</i>, a new play by David Javerbaum and directed by Joe Mantello. The play began previews at Studio 54 on May 5, 2015 and closed August 2, 2015, to positive reviews.</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, Parsons started hosting his own SiriusXM talk show, <i>Jim Parsons Is Too Stupid for Politics</i>. The show ran for six weeks.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Parsons was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook <i>A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo</i>.</p>', 'actors/jim-parsons_Cover.jpg'),

His father, Donald David Cryer (born 1936), is an actor and singer who originally studied to be a minister. Cryer\'s paternal grandfather, the Rev. Donald W. Cryer (1909-1988), was a well-known Methodist minister. He has two sisters, Robin and Shelly.</p>\r\n<p>When Cryer was twelve years old, he decided that he wanted to become an actor. When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked: \"Plumbing is a pretty good career.\" Cryer attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager, and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin. To his mother\'s \"great disappointment\", Cryer skipped college and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, United Kingdom for a summer short course in Shakespeare.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Cryer\'s first professional acting effort was as David in the Broadway play <i>Torch Song Trilogy</i>, replacing Matthew Broderick, whom he \"closely resembled\". Cryer was later an understudy and replacement for Broderick in Neil Simon\'s <i>Brighton Beach Memoirs</i> in 1989.</p>\r\n<p>At age 19, Cryer appeared in the 1984 romantic comedy film <i>No Small Affair</i>, in the lead role as Charles Cummings, after the original production with Matthew Broderick was shut down due to a heart attack by director Martin Ritt. He went on to have small roles in films and television movies, and he made his breakthrough as Phil \"Duckie\" Dem(p)ster in the John Hughes-scripted film <i>Pretty in Pink</i>. In an interview with the <i>Daily News</i>, Cryer\'s mother said that after <i>Pretty in Pink</i>, she started getting calls from teenage girls from all over the world, who would leave hysterical, giggling messages on her answering machine. In 1989, he got the lead role in the TV comedy series <i>The Famous Teddy Z</i>. His performance gained poor reviews and the show was canceled after the first season.</p>\r\n<p>A year later, he starred with Charlie Sheen in the Jim Abrahams comedy <i>Hot Shots!</i>, which was received very positively. Cryer is frequently linked to the Brat Pack. In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for <i>St. Elmo\'s Fire</i> but was not cast in a role. In 1993, he was asked to audition for the role of Chandler Bing on <i>Friends</i>, while doing a play in London. His reading was videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995, he was cast as Bob in the sitcom <i>Partners</i>, which, like his prior show <i>The Famous Teddy Z</i>, was canceled after its first season.

Although the show was picked up for a second season after its abbreviated spring run, it was canceled that fall, after airing 17 episodes in total. In 2000, he was cast as the lead in a comedy series called <i>The Trouble With Normal</i>. For the third time, Cryer starred in a show which was canceled after its first season.</p>\r\n<p>Cryer\'s long run of unsuccessful TV projects finally ended three years later. Against the wishes of CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series <i>Two and a Half Men</i>. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show\'s high ratings, he said: \"When you\'re on a show that\'s fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, \'My instincts haven\'t worked so far.\' But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes a huge amount of pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before.\" After former co-star Charlie Sheen\'s departure from the series, Cryer\'s character became the show\'s main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show\'s retooled plot. At the end of the series of <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series; Sheen was fired in March 2011 and Cryer\'s on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after describing the show as \"filth\" and calling himself a \"paid hypocrite\". All appeared to be forgiven later, as Jones, unlike Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. Before being cast for <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel\'s reimagined <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, but the role went to James Callis.

He was then transported to America an indentured servant to work at the Saugus Iron Works at Lynn, Massachusetts. As part of his research for the episode, Cryer visited the site of the Battle of Dunbar, Durham Cathedral in Durham, North East England - where surviving Scottish prisoners were held until they were indentured - and the Saugus Iron Works national historic site. Cryer said: \"Seeing the resilience of my family over centuries, you can see the legacy he left. I can\'t help but feel lucky...clearly, the resilience of my family, that spine of steel, was not something that came from nowhere. Moving forward, I\'m going to take James Adams\' strength as my inspiration and know that when you go through very, very difficult times, if you can turn around and help the people around you who had it even worse, that\'s real strength. And I aspire to be one of those people.\"</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2018, it was announced that Cryer had been cast as Lex Luthor on The CW\'s <i>Supergirl</i> in a recurring role, starting in the fifteenth episode of Season 4.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2019, Cryer joined other WGA writers in firing their agents as part of the WGA\'s stand against the ATA and the unfair practice of packaging.</p>', 'actors/jon-cryer_Cover.jpg'),

Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm enrolled at the University of Missouri. At Missouri he answered an advertisement from a theater company seeking players for a production of <i>A Midsummer Night\'s Dream</i>, auditioned, and was cast in the production. Other roles followed, such as Leon Czolgosz in <i>Assassins</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After graduating in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, Hamm returned to his high school to teach eighth-grade acting. One of his students was Ellie Kemper, who later became an actress and stars with him in the Netflix original television series, <i>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Not wishing to stay in a \"normal career\", Hamm relocated to Los Angeles permanently during 1995 with an automobile and $150. He relocated to a house with four other aspiring actors and began working as a waiter while attending auditions. He acted in theatre, including as Flavius in a production of Shakespeare\'s <i>Timon of Athens</i> with the Sacred Fools Theater Company. Looking older than his age, finding work as an actor was difficult, despite representation by the William Morris Agency. During 1998, having failed to obtain any acting jobs after three years, he was terminated as a client by William Morris.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm continued working as a waiter and, briefly, as a set designer for a softcore pornography movie. After repeatedly failing to get promising roles, Hamm set his 30th birthday as a deadline to succeed in Hollywood, stating:</p>\r\n<p>\"You either suck that up and find another agent, or you go home and say you gave it a shot, but that\'s the end of that. The last thing I wanted to be out here was one of those actors who\'s 45 years old, with a tenuous grasp of their own reality, and not really working much. So I gave myself five years. I said, if I can\'t get it going by the time I\'m 30, I\'m in the wrong place. And as soon as I said that, it\'s like I started working right away.</p>\r\n<p>During 2000, Hamm obtained the role of romantic firefighter Burt Ridley on NBC\'s drama series <i>Providence</i>. His one-episode contract grew to 19, and enabled him to quit waiting tables. Hamm made his feature movie debut with one line in Clint Eastwood\'s space adventure <i>Space Cowboys</i> (2000); more substantial roles followed in the independent comedy movie <i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i> (2001) and the war film <i>We Were Soldiers</i> (2002). During filming that movie, he turned 30. His career was bolstered by his playing the recurring role of police inspector Nate Basso on Lifetime\'s television series <i>The Division</i>, from 2002 to 2004. Other minor roles followed on the television series <i>What About Brian</i>, <i>CSI: Miami</i>, <i>Related</i>, <i>Numb3rs</i>, <i>The Unit</i>, and <i>The Sarah Silverman Program</i>. Hamm\'s <i>Mad Men</i> castmate Eric Ladin had said that one of the reasons he admires Hamm is that while he \"made it\" later than most actors, Hamm never gave up on acting.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm landed his breakthrough role during 2007, when he was cast from more than 80 candidates as the protagonist character Don Draper, in AMC\'s drama series <i>Mad Men</i>. In the series, set in a fictional 1960s advertising agency, he plays a suave, married advertising executive with an obscure past. He recalled, \"I read the script for <i>Mad Men</i> and I loved it. [...] I never thought they\'d cast me-- I mean, I thought they\'d go with one of the five guys who look like me but are movie stars\". He believes that an actor with a \"proven track record\" would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and <i>Mad Men</i> creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, \"it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part\". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper\'s backstory. Hamm says that he used memories of his father to portray Draper, a well-dressed, influential man of business and society hiding great inner turmoil and experiencing changes in the world beyond his control.</p>\r\n<p><i>Mad Men</i> debuted on July 19, 2007, with almost 1.4 million viewers. It developed a loyal audience, with Hamm receiving strong reviews. Robert Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> was complimentary of Hamm\'s performance, describing the actor\'s interpretation of Draper as a \"starmaking performance\". <i>The Boston Globe</i>\'s Matthew Gilbert termed Hamm a \"brilliant lead\".</p>\r\n<p>For his work, Hamm won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series - Drama during 2008. Also during 2008, he was nominated for both the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. During 2009, Hamm was again nominated for the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same category, and received another Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. During 2010, Mr. Hamm received his third Golden Globe Award nomination. <i>Mad Men</i> concluded its seven-season run on May 17, 2015. Hamm received his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series on September 20, 2015 after receiving 12 Emmy nominations for acting for and producing the series.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm\'s next film role was for the 2008 science fiction movie <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>, a remake of the 1951 film of the same name. Although the movie received mixed reviews, it was successful financially, earning $230 million worldwide. Hamm hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, season 34, episode 6, on October 25, 2008, and played various roles, including Don Draper in two sketches. He returned as host again on January 30 and October 30, 2010. During 2009, Hamm guest-featured in three episodes of the NBC television situation comedy show <i>30 Rock</i>, as Drew Baird, a doctor who is a neighbor and love interest of Liz Lemon\'s (Tina Fey). For these performances, he received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm\'s first leading film role came with the independent mystery thriller <i>Stolen</i> in 2009, in which he played a police officer whose son has been missing for eight years. Hamm had a minor voice role in the animated feature <i>Shrek Forever After</i>-released during May 2010-, as an ogre leader named Brogan. Also that year, he appeared as an FBI agent in the movie <i>The Town</i> (2010), with Ben Affleck. After having received \"about 40 scripts that were all set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys\", Hamm was pleased that the movie offered a role \"the opposite to Don Draper\". The feature received generally favorable reviews and earned $144 million worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>His next acting role was as defense attorney Jake Ehrlich in the independent film <i>Howl</i>, based on Allen Ginsberg\'s eponymous 1956 poem. On December 12, 2010, Hamm made a guest appearance as an FBI supervisor on Fox\'s animated series <i>The Simpsons</i>. He featured in Zack Snyder\'s action-fantasy film <i>Sucker Punch</i> (2011), as the character High Roller, and the doctor. He also had a supporting role in the comedy <i>Bridesmaids</i> as Kristen Wiig\'s \"rude and arrogant sex buddy\". Hamm was next seen in the independent feature <i>Friends with Kids</i> (2011), which he produced alongside his then-partner Jennifer Westfeldt. The story concerns a group of friends whose lives are changed as the couples in the group begin to have children.</p>\r\n<p>He had a recurring role in the situation comedy <i>The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret</i> in 2012, as the servant of socio-pathic billionaire Dave Mountford (Blake Harrison). Hamm hosted the 21st ESPYS Awards on July 17, 2013. The next year, he played sports agent J.B. Bernstein in Disney\'s sports drama <i>Million Dollar Arm</i> (2014).

(41, 'Julia', '', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'F', '<p>One of the most awarded actresses in American television history, winning more Emmy Awards and more Screen Actors Guild Awards than any other performer (eight of the Emmy Awards were for acting, tying Cloris Leachman for the most acting wins).</p>\r\n<p>Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City. Her American-born mother, Judith (née LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, chaired Louis Dreyfus Energy Services.</p>\r\n<p>She is a great-great-granddaughter of Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group. Pierre was from an Alsatian Jewish family; he remained in France during World War II, fighting as a cavalry officer and later in the French Resistance. Her paternal grandmother was born in America to parents from Brazil (of German descent) and Mexico; during the 1940s, she moved Julia\'s father to America from France.</p>\r\n<p>In 1962, one year after Louis-Dreyfus\'s birth, her parents divorced. After relocating to Washington, D.C., when Julia was eight, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, Dean of the George Washington University Medical School. During her childhood, her mother occasionally took her to Unitarian church services.</p>\r\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus spent her childhood in several states and countries, in connection with her stepfather\'s work with Project HOPE, including Vietnam, Colombia, and Tunisia. She graduated from the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1979.</p>\r\n<p>\"There were things I did in school (Holton-Arms School) that, had there been boys in the classroom, I would have been less motivated to do. For instance, I was president of the honor society.\"</p>\r\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she was a member of the Delta Gamma sorority. She studied theatre and performed in the Waa Mu Show, a student-run improv and sketch comedy revue, before dropping out during her junior year to take a job at <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. She later received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Northwestern University in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>As part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in The Second City, one of Chicago\'s best-known improvisational theatre groups, whose alumni include Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Shelley Long, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, John Candy, Chris Farley, Bob Odenkirk and many, many others who went on to become successful comedians and pop culture icons. It was her performance with The Practical Theatre Company at their \"Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee\" that led to her being asked to join the cast of NBC\'s <i>Saturday Night Live</i> at the age of 21.</p>\r\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus subsequently became a cast member on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> from 1982 to 1985, the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time. During her time on <i>SNL</i>, she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as Eddie Murphy, Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, and Martin Short. It was during her third and final year on <i>SNL</i> that she met writer Larry David during his only year on the show, who would later co-create <i>Seinfeld</i>. Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on <i>SNL</i> was a \"Cinderella-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience\"; however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she \"didn\'t know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show\".</p>\r\n<p>Following her 1985 departure from <i>SNL</i>, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including the Woody Allen-directed <i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i> (1986); <i>Soul Man</i> (1986), starring C. Thomas Howell; and <i>National Lampoon\'s Christmas Vacation</i> (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow <i>SNL</i> alumnus Chevy Chase. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot <i>The Art of Being Nick</i>, an intended spin-off from <i>Family Ties</i> starring Scott Valentine. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer Gary David Goldberg for a role on his new sitcom <i>Day by Day</i>, as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, <i>Day by Day</i> aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.</p>\r\n<p>In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC\'s <i>Seinfeld</i>. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O\'Donnell and Megan Mullally.</p>\r\n<p>On the \"Notes About Nothing\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus\' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\"</p>\r\n<p>Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a \"shocker\", and that after being in both positions, it was \"much better to win than to lose.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in.</p>\r\n<p>During her time on <i>Seinfeld</i> she appeared in several films, including <i>Fathers\' Day</i>, opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen\'s Oscar-nominated <i>Deconstructing Harry</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Following a voice role in the successful Disney Pixar\'s <i>A Bug\'s Life</i>, Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as Snake\'s girlfriend Gloria in <i>The Simpsons</i> episode \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\". In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on <i>Seinfeld</i> co-creator Larry David\'s show <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, playing herself fictionally trying to break the \"curse\" by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a <i>Seinfeld</i>-like curse.</p>\r\n<p>After several years away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, <i>Watching Ellie</i>, which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband Brad Hall, and co-starred Steve Carell and Louis-Dreyfus\' half-sister Lauren Bowles. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a \"slice of life\" from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and \"did nothing for the show.\" Overall, the show received mixed reviews, but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.</p>\r\n<p>When the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003, it suffered a decline in viewership, averaging around eight million viewers per week. The show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between production of seasons one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multicamera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience. With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its <i>Frasier</i> lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003.</p>\r\n<p>Following NBC\'s cancellation of <i>Watching Ellie</i>, the media began circulating rumors of a so-called \"Seinfeld curse\", which claimed that none of the former <i>Seinfeld</i> actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry. Louis-Dreyfus dismissed the rumor as \"a made-up thing by the media\", while <i>Seinfeld</i> co-creator Larry David asserted that the curse was \"completely idiotic.\"</p>\r\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus was interested in the role of Susan Mayer on <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, the role that ultimately went to Teri Hatcher. Instead, Louis-Dreyfus scored a recurring guest role as the deceitful prosecutor and love interest of Michael Bluth on the Emmy-winning comedy <i>Arrested Development</i>, from 2004 to 2005.</p>\r\n<p>In 2005, Louis-Dreyfus was cast in the title role of a new CBS sitcom <i>The New Adventures of Old Christine</i>. The series and its concept was created by writer and producer of <i>Will & Grace</i>, Kari Lizer. The series told the story of Christine Campbell, a single mother who manages to maintain a fantastic relationship with her ex-husband, while running a women\'s gym. The series debuted on CBS in March 2006 to an audience of 15 million and was initially a ratings winner for the network.</p>\r\n<p>Louis-Dreyfus also received considerable critical acclaim for her performance on the show, with Brian Lowry of <i>Variety</i> stating that Louis-Dreyfus broke the so-called \"<i>Seinfeld</i> curse [...] with one of the best conventional half-hours to come along in a while.\" Alessandra Stanley from <i>The New York Times</i> asserted that Louis-Dreyfus\' performance on the series proved she is \"one of the funniest women on network television.\" Louis-Dreyfus additionally earned the 2006 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the first season. Referring to the curse, she stated in her acceptance speech, \"I\'m not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!\" Throughout the course of the series, she received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations, three consecutive Satellite Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. In 2007, she also received two nominations for a People\'s Choice Award due to her return to popularity, thanks to the success of <i>Old Christine</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2006, Louis-Dreyfus hosted an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, becoming the first former female cast member to return to the show in the hosting role. In the episode, she appeared with former <i>Seinfeld</i> mates Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld in her opening monologue, parodying the so-called \"Seinfeld curse\". After a successful reception from her 2006 episode, Louis-Dreyfus was invited again to host <i>SNL</i> on March 17, 2007, and again on April 17, 2016. Louis-Dreyfus reprised her role as Gloria in two <i>Simpsons</i> episodes: 2007\'s \"I Don\'t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" and 2008\'s \"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes\". In the fall of 2009, she appeared with rest of the cast of <i>Seinfeld</i> in four episodes of the seventh season of Larry David\'s sitcom <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>. The reunion shows received much media attention, and the episode received strong ratings for the HBO series.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Louis-Dreyfus was granted the honorary award for Legacy of Laughter at the TV Land Awards. Previous winners had included Lucille Ball and Mike Myers. She was presented with the award by friend Amy Poehler. The following year, Louis-Dreyfus received the 2,407th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 4, 2010, for her remarkable contribution to the broadcast television industry as both an actress and a comedienne. Originally, the star was set with Louis-Dreyfus\' name spelled incorrectly. It was missing both the \'o\' and the hyphen in her last name. The star was corrected and the misspelled portion was removed and presented to the actress. Celebrity guests at the event included past and current colleagues from throughout her career, including Clark Gregg, Larry David, Eric McCormack, and Jason Alexander.</p>\r\n<p><i>Old Christine</i> was cancelled by CBS in May 2010, after five seasons. After its cancellation from CBS, discussions were held with ABC for the show to be revived on the network, but these plans never came to fruition.</p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 2010, Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred several times in the third season of the web series <i>Web Therapy</i>, starring Lisa Kudrow. Louis-Dreyfus played the sister of the main character Fiona Wallice, who gives her therapy online. When the series made the transition to cable television on the Showtime network, Louis-Dreyfus\' appearance from the web series was included in the second season, airing in July 2012.</p>\r\n<p>In fall 2010, Louis-Dreyfus made a guest appearance on the live episode of the Emmy-winning comedy <i>30 Rock</i>. She played Tina Fey\'s role of Liz Lemon in the cutaway shots. Louis-Dreyfus was among several <i>Saturday Night Live</i> alumni appearing in the episode, including Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, and regulars Tracy Morgan, Alec Baldwin, and Fey herself. Louis-Dreyfus also starred in a \"Women of SNL\" special November 1, 2010, on NBC.</p>\r\n<p>In May and June 2011, Louis-Dreyfus teamed up with husband Brad Hall for her first short film, <i>Picture Paris</i>. This was the first time the couple had collaborated since their early-2000s NBC comedy <i>Watching Ellie</i>. Hall wrote and directed the film, while Louis-Dreyfus played the lead role of an ordinary woman with an extraordinary obsession with the city of Paris. The film premiered on January 29, 2012, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and has received considerable critical acclaim. It made its television premiere on HBO on December 17, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>In early 2011, HBO confirmed that Louis-Dreyfus had been cast in the lead role of U.S. Vice President Selina Meyer in a new satirical comedy series titled <i>Veep</i>. The series was commissioned for a first season of eight episodes. It was announced, in addition to her starring role, Louis-Dreyfus would also serve as a producer of the series. In preparation for her role, Louis-Dreyfus spoke with two former vice presidents, including Al Gore, senators, speechwriters, chiefs of staffs of various offices and schedulers. Louis-Dreyfus has commended HBO for allowing the cast and crew to engage in a \"protracted pre-production process\", which included a six-week rehearsal period before filming began.</p>\r\n<p>The first season was filmed in the fall of 2011, in Baltimore, and the series premiered on April 22, 2012. The premiere episode was met with high praise from critics, particularly for Louis-Dreyfus\' performance. <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> asserted that the character of Selina Meyer was her \"best post-Seinfeld role\" to date and claimed that she gives \"an Emmy-worthy effort\", while the Los Angeles Times contended that the series demonstrates that she is \"one of the medium\'s great comediennes.\" Following the success of the first season, Louis-Dreyfus was named by the <i>Huffington Post</i> as one of the funniest people of 2012, asserting that she is the \"most magnetic and naturally funny woman on TV since Mary Tyler Moore.\"</p>\r\n<p>For her performance on <i>Veep</i>, Louis-Dreyfus has received several accolades, most notably six consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series from 2012-2017. Her Emmy wins for <i>Veep</i>, following previous wins for <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i>The New Adventures of Old Christine</i>, resulted in her becoming the only woman to win an acting award for three separate comedy series. Her sixth win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2016 surpassed the record previously held by Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen for the most wins in that category. Her sixth consecutive win, and eighth acting win overall, in 2017 made her the performer with the most Emmys for the same role in the same series (surpassing Candice Bergen and Don Knotts), and put her in a tie with Cloris Leachman for the most Emmys ever won by a performer. She was also nominated as one of the producers for <i>Veep</i> in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the show lost to <i>Modern Family</i> on all three occasions. The show, however, won the top award in 2015, 2016 and 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Louis-Dreyfus has also received five Critics\' Choice Television Award nominations, winning twice in 2013 and 2014, ten Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning twice in 2014 and 2017, and five Television Critics Association Award nominations, winning once in 2014.

In 2015, <i>TIME</i> featured her as one of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World\". She has been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>\r\n<p>Julianna Luisa Margulies was born in Spring Valley, New York, the youngest of three daughters. Her mother, Francesca (née Goldberg, later Gardner), was a ballet dancer and eurythmy teacher; her father, Paul Margulies, was a writer, philosopher, and Madison Avenue advertising executive. Her parents were both Jewish, descended from Jewish immigrants from Romania, Austria, Hungary, and Russia. Her mother converted to Christianity when the children were young, though Margulies still identifies herself as Jewish. The Margulies family lived in Israel for a period of time before Julianna\'s birth, then moved back to the Upper West Side of New York City.</p>\r\n<p>Margulies attended grade school at Green Meadow Waldorf School and high school at High Mowing School. As a child, she lived in New York, France, and England. She obtained a BA from Sarah Lawrence College.</p>\r\n<p>Margulies made her feature film debut in Steven Seagal\'s film <i>Out for Justice</i> (1991), playing a prostitute. In 1994, Margulies was cast in the pilot episode of the NBC medical drama <i>ER</i> as Carol Hathaway, an emergency care nurse who, despondent over her relationship with pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), attempted suicide. Her character was originally intended to die; however, the producers changed the plot and made Carol Hathaway a main cast member. At the same time Margulies had been offered an extended role on NBC\'s <i>Homicide: Life on the Streets</i>, after a two-episode appearance earlier in the year. Margulies chose <i>ER</i> and remained on the show for six seasons until 2000. She won an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Drama in 1994, and continued to be nominated for this award every year during her tenure on <i>ER</i>. She was the only series regular cast member to win an Emmy Award.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2012, Margulies broke her silence on her decision to leave <i>ER</i> at the height of her career and a $27 million paycheck. She revealed that although everyone said it would be \"career suicide\" not to return to the medical drama she had starred in for six years, she was never concerned about the consequences.</p>\r\n<p>\"I\'m a smart girl,\" said Margulies. \"I had a year\'s worth of work waiting and a mortgage completely paid at age 32.

My dad said, \'If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, were you living your life truthfully, or were you waiting to get rich?\' If I died and my soul started leaving my body, would I be looking down going, \'You idiot. You could have gone to Prague, you could have been on Broadway\'? Those are the things I wanted to do.\"</p>\r\n<p>After leaving the series, Margulies worked on stage and screen. On stage, she appeared in a MCC Theater production of Kate Robin\'s <i>Intrigue With Faye</i>, a Lincoln Center production of Jon Robin Baitz\'s <i>Ten Unknowns</i>, and <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>. Her film work after <i>ER</i> included <i>Evelyn</i> with Pierce Brosnan and <i>Ghost Ship</i> (2002) with Gabriel Byrne and Ron Eldard. She starred as the protagonist and narrator (Morgaine) in the TNT miniseries <i>The Mists of Avalon</i> (2001) and participated in the documentary film <i>Searching for Debra Winger</i> (2002).</p>\r\n<p>In 2004, she guest-starred in a two-episode arc in season 4 of the hit TV show <i>Scrubs</i> as Neena Broderick, an unscrupulous lawyer who sues Turk and has a brief sexual relationship with J.D. She starred in another miniseries on TNT, <i>The Grid</i>. In April 2006, she appeared in four episodes of the sixth season of <i>The Sopranos</i>, portraying realtor Julianna Skiff. In August 2006, she appeared in <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> as flight attendant Claire Miller. In December 2006, she played Jennifer Bloom in the Syfy Channel miniseries <i>The Lost Room</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In an August 2006 interview with tvguide.com, Margulies said she was close to accepting an offer to return to <i>ER</i> for a four-episode arc, with Noah Wyle, that filmed in Hawaii during the 2005/06 season. However, she decided against it at the last minute. Margulies was invited to return during <i>ER</i>\'s final season, but the actress initially turned down the offer, saying she felt like she left Carol Hathaway in the perfect place and could not imagine bettering her departure episode. However, Margulies did return to <i>ER</i> for one episode during its 15th and final season.</p>\r\n<p>She had a minor role in <i>The Darwin Awards</i> (2007). In 2008, Margulies starred in the legal series <i>Canterbury\'s Law</i>, a Fox mid-season replacement show. She played the title character, Elizabeth Canterbury, a lawyer described as a \"tough-minded defense attorney who isn\'t afraid to push boundaries in order to protect innocent clients.\" She was also credited as a producer of the show. The series was severely affected by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike; it was cancelled by the network after only six episodes.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Margulies began starring in the CBS legal drama <i>The Good Wife</i>. She played Alicia Florrick, an attorney returning to legal practice after her husband Peter Florrick (played by Chris Noth) resigned as Illinois State\'s Attorney amid a sex and corruption scandal. Beginning in 2011, starting with the third season, Margulies was credited as a producer of <i>The Good Wife</i>. The series ended in May 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2013, the actress does voiceovers for a Chase credit card commercial. In 2014, Margulies narrated \"Women in Business\", an episode of season 2 of <i>Makers: Women Who Make America</i>. In 2015, <i>TIME</i> featured Margulies as one of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\" It noted her work to get Erin\'s Law, concerned with child sexual abuse, passed in every US state.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Margulies co-starred in the dark comedy series <i>Dietland</i> on AMC as Kitty Montgomery - a nasty, razor-thin fashionista who employs an overweight woman for menial tasks and enjoys torturing her no end (especially about her weight).</p>\r\n<p>In 2019, she turned down CBS\' offer to guest star on the all access drama \"The Good Fight\" due to a pay dispute with the network. According to Deadline, Margulies asked the network for her regular fee at The Good Wife.</p>\r\n<p>However, the negotiations fell through when the television network responded by only offering to pay the actress the normal guest star fee. Not amenable to the offer, the actress shared with Deadline that: \"I\'m not a guest star. I started the whole thing with The Good Wife. I wanted to be paid my worth and stand up for equal pay. If Jon Hamm came back for a \'Mad Men\' spinoff or Kiefer Sutherland wanted to do a \'24\' spinoff, they would be paid\".</p>', 'actors/julianna-margulies_Cover.jpg');

(43, 'Julianne', '', 'Moore', 'F', '<p>Prolific in film since the early 1990s, she is particularly known for her portrayals of emotionally troubled women in both independent and Hollywood films, and has received many accolades, including an Academy Award and two Golden Globes. <i>Time</i> magazine named Moore one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Moore was born Julie Anne Smith on December 3, 1960, at the Fort Bragg army installation in North Carolina, the oldest of 3 siblings. Her father, Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, attained the rank of colonel and became a military judge. Her Scottish mother, Anne (née Love; 1940-2009), was a psychologist and social worker from Greenock, Scotland, who emigrated to the United States in 1951 with her family. Moore has a younger sister, Valerie Smith, and a younger brother, the novelist Peter Moore Smith. As Moore is half-Scottish, she claimed British citizenship in 2011 to honor her deceased mother.</p>\r\n<p>Moore frequently moved around the United States as a child, due to her father\'s occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: \"When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was ... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change.\"</p>\r\n<p>When Moore was 16, the family moved from Falls Church, Virginia, where Moore had been attending J.E.B. Stuart High School, to Frankfurt, Germany, where she attended Frankfurt American High School. She was clever and studious, a self-proclaimed \"good girl\", and she planned to become a doctor. She had never considered performing, or even attended the theatre, but she was an avid reader and it was this hobby that led her to begin acting at the school. She appeared in several plays, including <i>Tartuffe</i> and <i>Medea</i>, and with the encouragement of her English teacher, she chose to pursue a theatrical career. Moore\'s parents supported her decision, but asked that she train at university to provide the added security of a college degree. She was accepted to Boston University and graduated with a BFA in Theatre in 1983.</p>\r\n<p>Moore moved to New York City after graduating, and worked as a waitress. After registering her stage name with Actors\' Equity, she began her career in 1985 with off-Broadway theatre. Her first screen role came in 1985, in an episode of the soap opera <i>The Edge of Night</i>. Her break came the following year, when she joined the cast of <i>As the World Turns</i>. Playing the dual roles of half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina Hughes, she found this intensive work to be an important learning experience, and she said of it fondly: \"I gained confidence and learned to take responsibility.\" Moore performed on the show until 1988, when she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series. Before leaving <i>As the World Turns</i>, she had a role in the 1987 CBS miniseries <i>I\'ll Take Manhattan</i>. Once she had finished the soap opera, she turned to the stage to play Ophelia in a Guthrie Theater production of <i>Hamlet</i> opposite Zeljko Ivanek. The actress returned intermittently to television over the next three years, appearing in the TV movies <i>Money, Power, Murder</i> (1989), <i>The Last to Go</i> (1991), and <i>Cast a Deadly Spell</i> (1991).</p>\r\n<p>In 1990, Moore began working with stage director Andre Gregory on a workshop theatre production of Chekhov\'s <i>Uncle Vanya</i>. Described by Moore as \"one of the most fundamentally important acting experiences I ever had\", the group spent four years exploring the text and giving intimate performances to friends. Also in 1990, Moore made her cinematic debut as a mummy\'s victim in <i>Tales from the Darkside: The Movie</i>, a low-budget horror that she later described as \"terrible\". Her next film role, in 1992, introduced her to a wide audience. The thriller <i>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</i> - in which she played the main character\'s ill-fated friend - was number one at the US box office, and Moore caught the attention of several critics with her performance. She followed it the same year with the crime comedy <i>The Gun in Betty Lou\'s Handbag</i>, appearing as the protagonist\'s kooky sister. Moore continued to play supporting roles throughout 1993, first featuring in the erotic thriller <i>Body of Evidence</i> as Madonna\'s love rival. The film was a failure and widely mocked, and she later regretted her involvement. She had greater success in a 1993 romantic comedy with Johnny Depp. In <i>Benny & Joon</i>, she played a gentle waitress who falls for Aidan Quinn\'s character, Benny. Moore also appeared briefly as a doctor in one of the year\'s biggest hits, the Harrison Ford thriller <i>The Fugitive</i>.</p>\r\n<p>The filmmaker Robert Altman saw Moore in the <i>Uncle Vanya</i> production, and was sufficiently impressed to cast her in his next project: the ensemble drama <i>Short Cuts</i> (1993), based on short stories by Raymond Carver. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film <i>3 Women</i> (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when she saw it in college. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a \"total unknown\" surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore\'s breakout role. <i>Variety</i> magazine described her as \"arresting\" and noted that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would \"no doubt be the most discussed scene\" of the film. <i>Short Cuts</i> was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globe Awards. Moore received an individual nomination for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety.</p>\r\n<p><i>Short Cuts</i> was one of a trio of successive film appearances that boosted Moore\'s reputation. It was followed in 1994 with <i>Vanya on 42nd Street</i>, a filmed version of her ongoing <i>Uncle Vanya</i> workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore\'s performance of Yelena was described as \"simply outstanding\" by <i>Time Out</i>, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes\' low-budget film <i>Safe</i> (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, <i>Empire</i> magazine writes that <i>Safe</i> \"first established [Moore\'s] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation\". The film historian David Thomson later described it as \"one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s\", and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, \"They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing.\"</p>\r\n<p>Moore\'s next appearance was a supporting role in the comedy-drama <i>Roommates</i> (1995), playing the daughter-in-law of Peter Falk. Her following film, <i>Nine Months</i> (1995), was crucial in establishing her as a leading lady in Hollywood. The romantic comedy, directed by Chris Columbus and co-starring Hugh Grant, was poorly reviewed, but a box office success; it remains one of her highest-grossing films. Her next release was also a Hollywood production, as Moore appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas in the thriller <i>Assassins</i> (1995). Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide. Moore\'s only appearance of 1996 came in the Merchant Ivory film <i>Surviving Picasso</i>, where she played the artist Dora Maar opposite Anthony Hopkins. The period drama met with poor reviews.</p>\r\n<p>A key point in Moore\'s career came when she was cast by Steven Spielberg to star as paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in <i>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</i> - the sequel to his 1993 blockbuster <i>Jurassic Park</i>. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself \"tremendously\". It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, \"There was so much hanging everywhere. We hung off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things ... it was just non-stop.\" <i>The Lost World</i> (1997) finished as one of the ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: \"Suddenly I had a commercial film career\", she said. <i>The Myth of Fingerprints</i> was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy <i>Chicago Cab</i>.</p>\r\n<p>The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Moore achieve significant industry recognition. Her first Academy Award nomination came for the critically acclaimed <i>Boogie Nights</i> (1997), which centers on a group of individuals working in the 1970s pornography industry. Director Paul Thomas Anderson was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Moore agreed to the film after being impressed with his \"exhilarating\" script. The ensemble piece featured Moore as Amber Waves, a leading porn actress and mother-figure who longs to be re-united with her real son. Martyn Glanville of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of confidence and vulnerability, and was impressed with Moore\'s effort. <i>Time Out</i> called the performance \"superb\", while Janet Maslin of <i>The New York Times</i> found it \"wonderful\". Alongside her Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Moore was nominated at the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards, and several critics groups named her a winner.</p>\r\n<p>Moore followed her success in <i>Boogie Nights</i> with a role in the Coen brothers\' dark comedy <i>The Big Lebowski</i> (1998). The film was not a hit at the time of release, but subsequently became a cult classic. Her role was Maude Lebowski, a feminist artist and daughter of the eponymous character who becomes involved with \"The Dude\" (Jeff Bridges, the film\'s star). At the end of 1998, Moore had a flop with Gus Van Sant\'s <i>Psycho</i>, a remake of the classic Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name. She played Lila Crane in the film, which received poor reviews and is described by <i>The Guardian</i> as one of her \"pointless\" outings. The review in <i>Boxoffice</i> magazine regretted that \"a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives\" on the film.</p>\r\n<p>After re-uniting with Robert Altman for the dark comedy <i>Cookie\'s Fortune</i> (1999), Moore starred in <i>An Ideal Husband</i> - Oliver Parker\'s adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play. Set in London at the end of the 19th century, her performance of Mrs. Laura Cheverly earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. She was also nominated in the Drama category that year for her work in <i>The End of the Affair</i> (1999). Based on the novel by Graham Greene, Moore played opposite Ralph Fiennes as an adulterous wife in 1940s Britain. The critic Michael Sragow was full of praise for her work, writing that her performance was \"the critical element that makes [the film] necessary viewing\". Moore received her second Academy Award nomination for the role - her first for Best Actress - as well as nominations at the British Academy (BAFTA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards.</p>\r\n<p>In between her two Golden Globe-nominated performances, Moore was seen in <i>A Map of the World</i>, supporting Sigourney Weaver, as a bereaved mother. Her fifth and final film of 1999 was the acclaimed drama <i>Magnolia</i>, a \"giant mosaic\" chronicling the lives of multiple characters over one day in Los Angeles. Paul Thomas Anderson, in his follow-up to <i>Boogie Nights</i>, wrote a role specifically for Moore. His primary objective was to \"see her explode\", and he cast her as a morphine-addicted wife. Moore has said it was a particularly difficult role, but she was rewarded with a SAG nomination. She was subsequently named Best Supporting Actress of 1999 by the National Board of Review, in recognition of her three performances in <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>An Ideal Husband</i>, and <i>A Map of the World</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from a cameo role in the comedy <i>The Ladies Man</i>, Moore\'s only other appearance in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett\'s play <i>Not I</i>. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in <i>Hannibal</i>, a sequel to the Oscar winning film <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she was not interested in upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, <i>Hannibal</i> earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science-fiction-comedy <i>Evolution</i>, in her husband\'s dramatic film <i>World Traveler</i>, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in <i>The Shipping News</i>. All three films were poorly received.</p>\r\n<p>The year 2002 marked a high point in Moore\'s career, as she became the ninth performer to be nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year. She received a Best Actress nomination for the melodrama <i>Far from Heaven</i>, in which she played a 1950s housewife whose world is shaken when her husband reveals he is gay. The role was written specifically for her by Todd Haynes, the first time the pair had worked together since <i>Safe</i>, and Moore described it as \"a very, very personal project ... such an incredible honor to do\". David Rooney of <i>Variety</i> praised her \"beautifully gauged performance\" of a desperate woman \"buckling under social pressures and putting on a brave face\". Manohla Dargis of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote, \"what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters of what we call great acting that it nearly defies categorization\". The role won Moore the Best Actress award from 19 different organizations, including the Venice Film Festival and the National Board of Review.</p>\r\n<p>Moore\'s second Oscar nomination that year came for <i>The Hours</i>, which she co-starred in with Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep. She again played a troubled 1950s housewife, prompting Kenneth Turan to write that she was \"essentially reprising her <i>Far from Heaven</i> role\". Moore said it was an \"unfortunate coincidence\" that the similar roles came at the same time, and claimed that the characters had differing personalities. Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> called the performance \"wrenching\", while Peter Bradshaw of <i>The Guardian</i> praised a \"superbly controlled, humane performance\". <i>The Hours</i> was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Moore also received BAFTA and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and was jointly awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress with Kidman and Streep at the Berlin Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>Moore did not make any screen appearances in 2003, but returned in 2004 with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: <i>Marie and Bruce</i>, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, did not get a cinematic release; <i>Laws of Attraction</i> followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with <i>The Forgotten</i>, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.</p>\r\n<p>In 2005, Moore worked with her husband for the third time in the comedy <i>Trust the Man</i>, and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, <i>The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio</i>. Her first release of 2006 was <i>Freedomland</i>, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The response was overwhelmingly negative, but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuarón\'s <i>Children of Men</i> (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade.</p>\r\n<p>Moore made her Broadway debut in the world premiere of David Hare\'s play <i>The Vertical Hour</i>. The production, directed by Sam Mendes and co-starring Bill Nighy, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq challenged. Ben Brantley of <i>The New York Times</i> was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the \"tough, assertive\" quality that Nadia required. David Rooney of <i>Variety</i> criticized her \"lack of stage technique\", adding that she appeared \"stiffly self-conscious\". Moore later confessed that she found performing on Broadway difficult and had not connected with the medium, but was glad to have experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances.</p>\r\n<p>Moore played an FBI agent for the second time in <i>Next</i> (2007), a science fiction action film co-starring Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the response from critics was highly negative. Manhola Dargis wrote, \"Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to be here, and it\'s no wonder.\" The actress has since described it as her worst film. <i>Next</i> was followed by <i>Savage Grace</i> (2007), the true story of Barbara Daly Baekeland - a high-society mother whose Oedipal relationship with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. <i>Savage Grace</i> had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a \"coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie\".</p>\r\n<p><i>I\'m Not There</i> (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film explored the life of Bob Dylan, with Moore playing a character based on Joan Baez. In 2008, she starred with Mark Ruffalo in <i>Blindness</i>, a dystopian thriller from the director Fernando Meirelles. The film was not widely seen, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new releases. She had a supporting role in <i>The Private Lives of Pippa Lee</i>, and then starred in the erotic thriller <i>Chloe</i> with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the well-received drama <i>A Single Man</i>. Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film starred Colin Firth as a homosexual professor who wishes to end his life. Moore played his best friend, \"a fellow English expat and semi-alcoholic divorcee\", a character that Tom Ford, the film\'s writer-director, created with her in mind. Leslie Felperin of <i>Variety</i> commented that it was Moore\'s best role in \"some time\", and was impressed by the \"extraordinary emotional nuance\" of her performance. <i>A Single Man</i> was selected as one of the top 10 films of 2009 by the American Film Institute, and Moore received a fifth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.</p>\r\n<p>Moore returned to television for the first time in 18 years when she played a guest role in the fourth season of <i>30 Rock</i>. She appeared in five episodes of the Emmy-winning comedy, playing Nancy Donovan, a love interest for Alec Baldwin\'s character Jack Donaghy. She later appeared in the series finale in January 2013. She also returned to <i>As the World Turns</i>, making a cameo appearance as Frannie Hughes at the end of the show\'s run in 2010. Her first big-screen appearance of the new decade was <i>Shelter</i> (2010), a film described as \"heinous\" by Tim Robey of <i>The Telegraph</i>. The psychological thriller received negative reviews and did not have a US release until 2013 (retitled <i>6 Souls</i>).</p>\r\n<p>Moore next starred with Annette Bening in the independent film <i>The Kids Are All Right</i> (2010), a comedy-drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer-director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film\'s sexual content. The actress was drawn to the film\'s \"universal\" depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. <i>The Kids Are All Right</i> was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore\'s performance of Jules, who she called an \"existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty\", writing, \"There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera - sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally ... and Moore plays every note perfectly.\" <i>The Kids Are All Right</i> earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>For her next project, Moore actively looked for another comedy. She had a supporting role in <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i>, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film <i>Game Change</i>, a dramatization of Sarah Palin\'s 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although the response to the film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore\'s performance. For the first time in her career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award.</p>\r\n<p>Moore made two film appearances in 2012. The drama <i>Being Flynn</i>, in which she supported Robert De Niro, had a limited release. Greater success came for <i>What Maisie Knew</i>, the story of a young girl caught in the middle of her parents\' divorce. Adapted from Henry James\'s novel and updated to the 21st century, the drama earned near-universal critical praise. The role of Susanna, Maisie\'s rock-star mother, required Moore to sing on camera, which was a challenge she embraced despite finding it embarrassing. She called Susanna a terrible parent, but said the role did not make her uncomfortable, as she fully compartmentalized the character: \"I know that that\'s not me\".</p>\r\n<p>Following her well-received performance in <i>What Maisie Knew</i>, Moore began 2013 with a supporting role in Joseph Gordon-Levitt\'s comedy <i>Don Jon</i>, playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of <i>Time</i> magazine wrote that Moore was a key factor in its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy <i>The English Teacher</i> (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother Margaret White in <i>Carrie</i>, an adaptation of Stephen King\'s horror novel. Coming 37 years after Brian De Palma\'s well-known take on the book, Moore stated that she wanted to make the role her own. By drawing on King\'s writing rather than the 1976 film, Mick LaSalle of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> wrote that she managed to \"[suggest] a history - one never told, just hinted at - of serious damage in [Margaret\'s] past\". Although the film was a box office success, it was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation.</p>\r\n<p>At age 53, Moore enjoyed a considerable degree of critical and commercial success in 2014. Her first release of the year came alongside Liam Neeson in the action-thriller <i>Non-Stop</i>, set aboard an airplane. The response to the film was mixed, but it earned $223 million worldwide. She followed this by winning the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance as Havana Segrand, an aging actress receiving psychotherapy in David Cronenberg\'s black comedy <i>Maps to the Stars</i>. Described by <i>The Guardian</i> as a \"grotesque, gaudy, and ruthless\" character, Moore based her role on \"an amalgam of Hollywood casualties she ha[d] encountered\", and drew upon her early experiences in the industry. Peter Debruge of <i>Variety</i> criticized the film, but found Moore to be \"incredible\" and \"fearless\" in it. Moore\'s success at Cannes made her the second actress in history, after Juliette Binoche, to win Best Actress awards at the \"Big Three\" film festivals (Berlin, Cannes, and Venice). She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.</p>\r\n<p>Moore played the supporting role of President Alma Coin, the leader of a rebellion against The Capitol, in the third installment of the lucrative <i>The Hunger Games</i> film series, <i>Mockingjay - Part 1</i>. The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final appearance of 2014 was one of the most acclaimed of her career. In the drama <i>Still Alice</i>, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\'s disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer\'s Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was \"extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence\", while according to Kenneth Turan, she was \"especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out\". Several critics commented that it was her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Moore began 2015 by appearing as an evil queen in <i>Seventh Son</i>, a poorly received fantasy-adventure film co-starring Jeff Bridges. She also appeared opposite Ellen Page in <i>Freeheld</i>, a drama based on a true story about a detective and her same-sex partner, and in the romantic comedy <i>Maggie\'s Plan</i>, with Greta Gerwig and Ethan Hawke. Both films were presented at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival in September 2015. In <i>Maggie\'s Plan</i>, Moore played a pretentious Danish professor, a comic role which critic Richard Lawson of <i>Vanity Fair</i> deemed as the film\'s \"chief pleasure\". Later that year, she reprised her role as Alma Coin in <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2</i>, the final film of the series.</p>\r\n<p>After a one-year absence from the screen, Moore had three film releases in 2017. She appeared in a dual role in <i>Wonderstruck</i>, a film adaptation of Brian Selznick\'s historical children\'s novel of the same name, which reteamed her with Todd Haynes. Her parts were of a silent movie star in the 1920s and a deaf librarian in the 1970s; in preparation, she studied sign language and watched the films of Lillian Gish. Richard Lawson considered her to be \"eminently watchable\" despite her limited screen time. Moore portrayed a dual role for the second time that year in <i>Suburbicon</i>, a satirical thriller written by the Coen brothers and directed by George Clooney. She was cast opposite Matt Damon as twin sisters in 1950s America, named Rose and Margaret, who become embroiled in a local crime. The film received negative reviews, with critics saying it failed to effectively portray American racism, but Geoffrey Macnab of <i>The Independent</i> praised Moore for giving \"a perfectly judged comic performance as a Barbara Stanwyck-like femme fatale\".</p>\r\n<p>Moore\'s final release of the year was the sequel to the 2015 spy film <i>Kingsman: The Secret Service</i>, subtitled <i>The Golden Circle</i>, co-starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Channing Tatum, and Halle Berry. She played the part of the villainous entrepreneur Poppy Adams, who runs a drug cartel. Despite her character\'s actions, Moore played the part to make Poppy seem \"strange, but reasonable\". Peter Debruge described the film as \"outlandish\", and wrote that Moore had played her part \"as Martha Stewart crossed with a demonic 1950s housewife\". The film earned over $410 million worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Moore had two film releases in 2018. She was drawn to Sebastián Lelio\'s <i>Gloria Bell</i>, an English-language remake of Lelio\'s own Chilean film <i>Gloria</i>, for its rare depiction of a middle-age woman\'s quest for meaning in life. Stephen Dalton of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> believed that she had delivered \"an utterly natural and quietly spellbinding star performance\". Her second release that year was <i>Bel Canto</i>, a thriller based on Ann Patchett\'s novel of the same name about the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. For her performance as an opera singer, she learnt to mimic the body language of professionals for scenes in which Renée Fleming performed the vocals. Guy Lodge of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> deemed the film an unsuccessful adaptation of the novel and considered Moore\'s work to be \"edgeless fare by her standards\". The following year, she teamed with her husband once again in <i>After the Wedding</i>, a remake of Susanne Bier\'s Danish film of the same name. It featured her and Michelle Williams in roles played by men in the original film. That same year, she will star in <i>The Staggering Girl</i>, a short film directed by Luca Guadagnino.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Moore will next portray the feminist icon Gloria Steinem in the biopic <i>The Glorias: A Life on the Road</i>, sharing the part with the actresses Alicia Vikander and Lulu Wilson. She will then feature in Joe Wright\'s thriller <i>The Woman in the Window</i>, based on the novel of the same name, co-starring Amy Adams and Gary Oldman, and in <i>Lisey\'s Story</i>, an Apple TV+ miniseries adapted from Stephen King\'s thriller novel of the same name.</p>', 'actors/julianne-moore_Cover.jpg'),

(46, 'Leonardo', '', 'DiCaprio', 'M', '<p>Been nominated for six Academy Awards, four British Academy Film Awards and nine Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning one of each award from them and three Golden Globe Awards from eleven nominations.</p><p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles. He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books. DiCaprio\'s father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent. DiCaprio\'s maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken (1913-1995), was German. His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915-2008), was a Russian-born German citizen. In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as \"half-Russian\" and said that two of his late grandparents were Russian. DiCaprio\'s parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.</p>\r\n<p>DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked. His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years. He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED). DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.</p>\r\n<p>In 1979, DiCaprio was removed, at the age of five, from the set of the children\'s television series <i>Romper Room</i> for being disruptive. He began his career by appearing in several commercials and educational films, following his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, and landing an ad at age 14 for Matchbox cars by Mattel, which he considered his first role. Throughout his teens he was seen in commercials for Kraft Foods, Bubble Yum, Apple Jacks, and many more. In 1989, he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show <i>The New Lassie</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In 1990, he started acting regularly on television. This started with a role in the pilot of <i>The Outsiders</i>, and one episode of the soap opera <i>Santa Barbara</i>, playing the young Mason Capwell. That same year, DiCaprio got a break on television when he was cast in <i>Parenthood</i>, a series based on a successful comedy film by the same name. His works that year earned him two nomination at the Young Artist Award in Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series (<i>Santa Barbara</i>) and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series (<i>Parenthood</i>). DiCaprio was also a celebrity contestant on the children\'s game show <i>Fun House</i>. One of the stunts he performed on the show was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.</p>\r\n<p>In 1991, he played an un-credited role in one episode of <i>Roseanne</i>. Later that year, DiCaprio\'s debut film role was in the comedic science fiction horror film <i>Critters 3</i>, in which he played the stepson of an evil landlord, a role that DiCaprio described as \"your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair.\" Released in March that year, the movie went direct-to-video. Shortly after, he became a recurring cast member on the successful ABC sitcom <i>Growing Pains</i>, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. DiCaprio was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992, alongside Drew Barrymore, Sara Gilbert, Tom Skerritt, and Cheryl Ladd, he played a supporting role in the first installment of the <i>Poison Ivy</i> film series. It was nominated for the 1992 Grand Jury prize of Best Film at the Sundance Film Festival and received a nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 1992, DiCaprio was handpicked by Robert De Niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in <i>This Boy\'s Life</i> adapted from Tobias Wolff\'s memoir of the same name. He played opposite De Niro, who was acting as his stepfather, and Ellen Barkin as his mother. The film was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and released in 1993.</p>\r\n<p>In 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of Johnny Depp\'s character in <i>What\'s Eating Gilbert Grape</i>, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional Iowa family. Director Lasse Hallström admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor but finally settled on DiCaprio as he had emerged as \"the most observant actor\" among all who auditioned. Budgeted at US$11 million, the film became a critical success, resulting in various accolades for DiCaprio, who was awarded the National Board of Review Award and nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal. <i>The New York Times</i> critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio\'s performance, writing \"the film\'s real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie\'s many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end.\"</p>\r\n<p>DiCaprio\'s first effort of 1995 was Sam Raimi\'s <i>The Quick and the Dead</i>, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio\'s casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor\'s salary herself. The film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. He next starred in Agnieszka Holland\' <i>Total Eclipse</i>, which he co-lead with David Thewlis. The feature is a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud (DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (Thewlis). He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run. His last film of the year 1995 was <i>The Basketball Diaries</i>, co- starring Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg. It is a biographical film, in which DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll in his teenage years as a promising high school basketball player and writer who developed an addiction to heroin with his misguided friends.</p>\r\n<p>In 1996, DiCaprio appeared opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann\'s film <i>Romeo + Juliet</i>, an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare\'s romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. The project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million. Later that year, he starred in Jerry Zaks\' family drama <i>Marvin\'s Room</i>, reuniting with Robert De Niro. Based on Scott McPherson\'s screenplay adaptation of his own 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep\'s character\'s troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum for setting fire to his mother\'s house.</p>\r\n<p>In 1997, DiCaprio starred in James Cameron\'s <i>Titanic</i> (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two tickets for the third-class on the ill-fated RMS <i>Titanic</i>. DiCaprio initially refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron\'s film <i>Avatar</i>), grossing more than $1.84 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as \"Leo-Mania\". In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller list. More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest him not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards. He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of <i>Titanic</i>, DiCaprio stated in 2000: \"I have no connection with me during that whole <i>Titanic</i> phenomenon and what my face became around the world ... I\'ll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don\'t expect to. It\'s not something I\'m going to try to achieve either.\"</p>\r\n<p>The following year, DiCaprio played a self-mocking role in a small appearance in Woody Allen\'s caustic satire of the fame industry, <i>Celebrity</i> (1998). It features an ensemble cast that consists of Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Winona Ryder, Melanie Griffith, Joe Mantegna, Charlize Theron, Hank Azaria, Famke Janssen, Donald Trump, etc.</p>\r\n<p>That year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace\'s <i>The Man in the Iron Mask</i>, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite receiving a rather mixed to negative response, the film became a box office success, grossing US$180 million internationally. Though DiCaprio\'s performance was generally well-received, with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> critic Owen Gleiberman writing that \"the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely old enough to be playing anyone with hormones, but he\'s a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel,\" he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.</p>\r\n<p>DiCaprio\'s next project was the drama film <i>The Beach</i> (2000), an adaption of Alex Garland\'s 1996 novel of the same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $ US 50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $ US 144 million worldwide, but as with DiCaprio\'s previous project, the film was negatively reviewed by critics. Todd McCarthy of <i>Variety</i> noted that \"Richard [DiCaprio\'s role] is too much the American Everyman and not enough of a well-defined individual to entirely capture one\'s interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character.\" The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.</p>\r\n<p>In the mid 1990s, DiCaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called <i>Don\'s Plum</i>, as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics.</p>\r\n<p>DiCaprio\'s first film of 2002 was in Martin Scorsese\'s <i>Gangs of New York</i>, a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, <i>Gangs of New York</i> became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio\'s acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis\' performance among most critics.</p>\r\n<p>Also in 2002, DiCaprio appeared the biographical crime drama film <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several different personas, to make millions in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it \"the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making\" DiCaprio had experienced yet. <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio\'s highest-grossing film since <i>Titanic</i> with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide. Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while \"DiCaprio, who in recent films ... has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it.\" The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.</p>\r\n<p>In 2004 DiCaprio took his first producing task in Niels Mueller\' <i>The Assassination of Richard Nixon</i>, as one of the executives. It stars Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson and Naomi Watts, and is based on the story of would-be assassin Samuel Byck, who plotted to kill Richard Nixon in 1974. It received a Un Certain Regard nomination at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It won and was nominated for many Awards in the festival circuit. Forging a collaboration with Scorsese, the two paired again for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in <i>The Aviator</i> (2004). Centering on Hughes\' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after working on back-to-back biopics; <i>Ali</i> and <i>The Insider</i>. The actor eventually pitched John Logan\'s script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. <i>The Aviator</i> became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.</p>\r\n<p>In 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the <i>Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</i> by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts. The following year, the actor starred in both <i>Blood Diamond</i> and <i>The Departed</i>. In Edward Zwick\'s war film <i>Blood Diamond</i>, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews, and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate.</p>\r\n<p>In Scorsese\'s <i>The Departed</i> he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006. Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese\'s highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating <i>The Aviator</i>\'s previous record of US$213.7 million. DiCaprio\'s performance in <i>The Departed</i> was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor. The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for <i>Blood Diamond</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In 2007, DiCaprio produced <i>Gardener of Eden</i> directed by Kevin Connolly. It stars Lukas Haas, Erika Christensen and Giovanni Ribisi. The film is about Adam Harris (Haas), a twenty-something college dropout lacking real direction in his life. Adam\'s life changes dramatically when he accidentally captures a serial rapist. The new-found attention inspires him to become a vigilante. Shortly after saw the release of <i>The 11th Hour</i>. A documentary film which he created, produced, co-written and narrated. With contributions from over 50 politicians, scientists, and environmental activists, including former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, physicist Stephen Hawking, Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai, journalist Armand Betscher, and Paul Hawken, the film documents the grave problems facing the planet\'s life systems. Global warming, deforestation, mass species extinction, and depletion of the oceans\' habitats are all addressed. The film\'s premise is that the future of humanity is in jeopardy. The film proposes potential solutions to these problems by calling for restorative action by the reshaping and rethinking of global human activity through technology, social responsibility and conservation.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, DiCaprio starred in <i>Body of Lies</i>, a spy film based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as <i>The Parallax View</i> (1974) and <i>Three Days of the Condor</i> (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide. Later that year, DiCaprio reunited with Kate Winslet to film the drama <i>Revolutionary Road</i> (2008), directed by Winslet\'s then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to <i>Titanic</i>, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster. Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost immediately into production. He noted that he saw his character as \"unheroic\" and \"slightly cowardly\" and that he was \"willing to be just a product of his environment.\" Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, which eventually earned them favorable reviews. For his portrayal DiCaprio garnered his seventh Golden Globes nomination. Also in 2008, he was a creator and an executive producer for <i>Greensburg</i> an American television series broadcast on the Planet Green television network. The show takes place in Greensburg, Kansas, and is about rebuilding the town in a sustainable way after being hit by the May 2007 EF5 tornado. He was a producer for the psychological horror thriller film <i>Orphan</i> directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. The film stars Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Isabelle Fuhrman, C. C. H. Pounder and Jimmy Bennett. The plot centers on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. DiCaprio continued his collaborative streak with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film <i>Shutter Island</i> (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played U.S. Marshal Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island and comes to question his own sanity. The film grossed $294 million. Also in 2010, DiCaprio starred in director Christopher Nolan\'s science-fiction film <i>Inception</i>, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation, DiCaprio portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an \"extractor\" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target\'s mind. DiCaprio was \"intrigued by this concept-this dream-heist notion and how this character\'s gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.\" Released to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide. To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet. The movie went on to become Di Caprio\'s second highest-grossing movie with $293 million at the box office, after <i>Titanic</i> with $659 million and ahead of <i>The Revenant</i> with $184 million.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, DiCaprio starred alongside Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts in Clint Eastwood\'s <i>J. Edgar</i>, a biopic about J. Edgar Hoover.

Reviews towards the film were mostly mixed, with many critics commending DiCaprio\'s performance but feeling that, overall, the film lacked coherence.

Scott Fitzgerald\'s 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, however DiCaprio\'s portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of <i>Newsday</i> praised DiCaprio by stating, \"As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he is now the Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance - haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin\'s \"Rhapsody in Blue\"-DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He\'s as tough as Alan Ladd in \'49, as suave as Redford in \'74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby\'s favorite phrase, \"old sport,\" a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It\'s a tremendous, hard-won performance.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of <i>Roger Ebert.com</i> described his performance as Gatsby as \"The movie\'s greatest and simplest special effect,\" and states \"This is an iconic performance-maybe his career best.\" The film grossed $348 million worldwide and became Luhrmann\'s highest-grossing film.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. DiCaprio reunited with Scorsese for the fifth time in <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>, a film based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering.

The family had left Kenya in 1980 for a period because of political repression and unrest; Peter\'s brother, Charles Nyong\'o, disappeared after he was thrown off a ferry in 1980.</p>\r\n<p>Nyong\'o identifies as Kenyan-Mexican and has dual Kenyan and Mexican citizenship. She is of Luo descent on both sides of her family, and is the second of six children. It is a tradition of the Luo people to name a child after the events of the day, so her parents gave her a Spanish name, Lupita (a diminutive of Guadalupe). Her father is a former Minister for Medical Services in the Kenyan government. At the time of her birth, he was a visiting lecturer in political science at El Colegio de México in Mexico City. He later became a senior politician in Kenya.</p>\r\n<p>The family returned to their native Kenya when Nyong\'o was less than one year old, as her father was appointed a professor at the University of Nairobi. She grew up primarily in Nairobi, and describes her upbringing as \"middle class, suburban\". When she was 16, her parents sent her to Mexico for seven months to learn Spanish. During those seven months, Nyong\'o lived in Taxco, Guerrero, and took classes at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México\'s Learning Center for Foreigners.</p>\r\n<p>Nyong\'o grew up in an artistic family, where get-togethers often included performances by the children, and trips to see plays.

She has an incredible ability to convey backstory.\" Geoff Berkshire of <i>Variety</i> called Nyong\'o\'s performance \"Simply radiant in her first live action role since winning an Oscar for <i>12 Years a Slave</i> [...] she imbues what could have been a stock mother figure with such inner fire that Harriet feels worthy of a movie all her own.\"</p>\r\n<p>Nyong\'o reprised her role as Maz Kanata in Rian Johnson\'s <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i> (2017), as well as in the animated series <i>Star Wars Forces of Destiny</i>.

In preparation for the role, Nyong\'o learned to speak Xhosa and undertook judo, jujitsu, silat, and Filipino martial arts training. David Betancourt of <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote that the film \"takes superhero cinema where it\'s never gone before by not being afraid to embrace its blackness\"; he particularly praised Nyong\'o\'s portrayal of her character for avoiding stereotypical depictions of a black leading lady, writing that she \"throws punches, shoots guns and steals hearts in a role she seems born for.\" <i>Black Panther</i> earned over $1.34 billion to emerge as the ninth highest-grossing film of all time. Nyong\'o received a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination for the film.</p>\r\n<p>Following the success of <i>Black Panther</i>, Nyong\'o starred as a kindergarten teacher dealing with a zombie apocalypse in the comedy horror film <i>Little Monsters</i> (2019).

The 2019 South by Southwest marked the premiere of her next release, Jordan Peele\'s psychological horror film <i>Us</i>. It tells the story of a family who are confronted by their doppelgängers. Emily Yoshida of <i>New York</i> magazine labeled her dual role \"astounding\" and found her portrayal of the doppelgänger to be \"an achievement on another level; a physical, vocal, and emotional performance so surgical in its uncanniness that it almost feels like it could not be the work of a flesh-and-blood human.\" <i>Us</i> earned over $252 million against a budget of $20 million.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Nyong\'o will reprise her role as Maz Kanata for the third time in <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> (2019), which will mark the final installment of the <i>Star Wars</i> sequel trilogy.

She has been a Goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 1994 and for UNIFEM since 2006. In 2006, Kidman was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia and was the highest-paid actress in the motion picture industry for that year.</p>\r\n<p>Nicole Mary Kidman was born 20 June 1967, in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her mother, Janelle Ann (née Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband\'s books and was a member of the Women\'s Electoral Lobby. Her father was Antony Kidman (1938-2014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75. Kidman\'s ancestry includes Irish and Scottish heritage.</p>\r\n<p>Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name \"Hokulani\", meaning \"Heavenly Star\". The inspiration came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo.</p>\r\n<p>At the time of Kidman\'s birth, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawai?i at Manoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman\'s parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C. The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney\'s North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.</p>\r\n<p>Kidman grew up in Sydney and attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls\' High School.

She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton\'s performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, \"I am very shy - really shy - I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don\'t like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don\'t like going to a party by myself.\"</p>\r\n<p>She initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. At Philip Street, Kidman studied alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school. She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People. Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received both encouragement and praise to pursue acting full-time.</p>\r\n<p>In 1983, aged 16, Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday season favourite <i>Bush Christmas</i>. By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series <i>Five Mile Creek</i>.

The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; <i>Variety</i> commented: \"Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy.\" Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, \"Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.\" She followed that up with the Australian miniseries <i>Bangkok Hilton</i>. She next moved on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 auto racing film <i>Days of Thunder</i>, as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver.

Of Kidman\'s Golden Globe award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> said \"[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up - as she does throughout the film - Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same.\" Kidman next appeared, alongside Barbara Hershey and John Malkovich, in <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> (1996), based on the novel of the same name, and starred in <i>The Peacemaker</i> (1997) as White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney.

In 2001, Kidman played the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann\'s musical <i>Moulin Rouge!</i>, opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of <i>CNN.com</i> called it her best work since <i>To Die For</i>, and wrote \"[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in \"ice queen\" characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit.\" Subsequently, Kidman received her second Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Kidman also starred in Alejandro Amenábar\'s horror film <i>The Others</i> (2001), as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over US$210 million worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Awards award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA and fifth Golden Globe nominations. Roger Ebert commented that \"Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.\" Kidman was named the World\'s Most Beautiful Person by <i>People</i> magazine.</p>\r\n<p>In 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry\'s <i>The Hours</i>, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. <i>The New York Times</i> wrote that, \"Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain\". Kidman won numerous critics\' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during times of war, saying, \"Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.\"</p>\r\n<p>Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in <i>Dogville</i>, by Danish director Lars von Trier, was an experimental film set on a bare soundstage. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine stated: \"Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn\'t stomp on.\" The second was an adaptation of Philip Roth\'s novel <i>The Human Stain</i>, opposite Anthony Hopkins. Her third film was Anthony Minghella\'s war drama <i>Cold Mountain</i>. Kidman appeared opposite Jude Law and Renée Zellweger, playing Southerner Ada Monroe, who is in love with Law\'s character and separated by the Civil War. <i>TIME</i> magazine wrote, \"Kidman takes strength from Ada\'s plight and grows steadily, literally luminous.

Her second film with Firth was the British thriller film <i>Before I Go To Sleep</i>, portraying a car crash survivor with brain damage. She also appeared in the family film <i>Paddington</i> (2014) as a villain.</p>\r\n<p>In 2015, Kidman starred in the drama <i>Strangerland</i>, which opened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, and the Jason Bateman-directed <i>The Family Fang</i>, produced by Kidman\'s production company, Blossom Films, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. In her other 2015 film release, the biographical drama <i>Queen of the Desert</i>, she portrayed writer, traveller, political officer, administrator, and archaeologist Gertrude Bell. Kidman played a district attorney, opposite Julia Roberts and Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the little-seen film <i>Secret in Their Eyes</i> (also 2015), a remake of the 2009 Argentine film of the same name, both based on the novel <i>La pregunta de sus ojos</i> by author Eduardo Sacheri. After more than 15 years, Kidman returned to the West End in the UK premiere of <i>Photograph 51</i> at the Noël Coward Theatre. She starred as British scientist Rosalind Franklin, working for the discovery of the structure of DNA, in the production from 5 September to 21 November 2015, directed by Michael Grandage. Her return to the West End was hailed a success, especially after having won an acting award for her portrayal in the play.</p>\r\n<p>In 2016\'s <i>Lion</i>, Kidman portrayed Sue, the adoptive mother of Saroo Brierley, an Indian boy who was separated from his birth family, a role she felt connected to as she herself is the mother of adopted children. She earned favorable reviews for her performance, as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, her fourth nomination overall, and her eleventh Golden Globe nomination, among others. Richard Roeper of <i>The Chicago Sun-Times</i> thought that \"Kidman gives a powerful and moving performance as Saroo\'s adoptive mother, who loves her son with every molecule of her being, but comes to understand his quest. It\'s as good as anything she\'s done in the last decade.\" Budgeted at US$12 million, <i>Lion</i> earned over US$140 million globally. She also gave a voice-over performance for the English version of the animated film <i>The Guardian Brothers</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, Kidman returned to television for <i>Big Little Lies</i>, a drama series based on Liane Moriarty\'s novel, which premiered on HBO. She also served as producer alongside her co-star, Reese Witherspoon, and the show\'s director, Jean-Marc Vallée. She played Celeste Wright, a former lawyer and housewife, who is concealing her abusive relationship with her husband, played by Alexander Skarsgård. Matthew Jacobs of <i>The Huffington Post</i> considered that she \"delivered a career-defining performance\", while Ann Hornaday of <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote that \"Kidman belongs in the pantheon of great actresses\". She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance, as well as winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series as a producer. She also won a Golden Globe Critics Choice Award and SAG Award.</p>\r\n<p>Kidman next played Martha Farnsworth, the headmistress of an all-girls school during the American Civil War, in Sofia Coppola\'s drama <i>The Beguiled</i>, a remake of a 1971 film of the same name, which premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, competing for the Palme d\'Or. Both films were adaptations of a novel by Thomas P. Cullinan. The film was an arthouse success, and Katie Walsh of <i>Tribune News Service</i> found Kidman to be \"particularly, unsurprisingly excellent in her performance as the steely Miss Martha. She is controlled and in control, unflappable. Her genteel manners and femininity co-exist easily with her toughness.\" Kidman had two other films premiere at the festival, the science-fiction romantic comedy <i>How to Talk to Girls at Parties</i>, reuniting her with director John Cameron Mitchell, and the psychological thriller <i>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</i>, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which also competed for the Palme d\'Or. Also in 2017, Kidman played supporting roles in the television series <i>Top of the Lake: China Girl</i> and in the comedy-drama <i>The Upside</i>, a remake of the 2011 French comedy <i>The Intouchables</i>, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart.</p>\r\n<p>Kidman starred in two 2018 dramas -<i>Destroyer</i> and <i>Boy Erased</i>. In the former, she played a detective troubled by a case for two decades. Peter Debruge of <i>Variety</i> and Brooke Marine of <i>W</i> both found her \"unrecognizable\" in the role and Debruge added that \"she disappears into an entirely new skin, rearranging her insides to fit the character\'s tough hide\", whereas Marine highlighted Kidman\'s method acting. The latter film is based on Garrard Conley\'s <i>Boy Erased: A Memoir</i>, and features Russell Crowe and Kidman as socially conservative parents who send their son (played by Lucas Hedges) to a gay conversion program. Richard Lawson of <i>Vanity Fair</i> credited all three performers for \"elevating the fairly standard-issue material to poignant highs\". Also that year, Kidman played Queen Atlanna, the mother of the title character, in the DC Extended Universe superhero film <i>Aquaman</i>.</p>\r\n<p>She has finished filming her supporting role as Mrs. Barbour in John Crowley\'s <i>The Goldfinch</i>, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Donna Tartt, starring Ansel Elgort. Kidman has filmed a second season of <i>Big Little Lies</i>, will star in another HBO miniseries, <i>The Undoing</i>, based on the novel <i>You Should Have Known</i> by Jean Hanff Korelitz, and will portray Gretchen Carlson in <i>Fair and Balanced</i>, a drama about sexual harassment at Fox News.</p>', 'actors/nicole-kidman_Cover.jpg'),
(58, 'Patricia', '', 'Arquette', 'F', '<p>Patricia Arquette was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968 to Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Olivia \"Mardi\" (née Nowak), who was involved in the arts and worked as a therapist. Through her father, Patricia is distantly related to explorer Meriwether Lewis. Arquette\'s father had converted from Catholicism to Islam. Arquette\'s mother was Jewish, and her ancestors emigrated from Poland and Russia. Her father\'s family\'s surname was originally \"Arcouet\", and his paternal line was of French-Canadian descent. Her paternal grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. Patricia\'s siblings also became actors: Rosanna, Richmond, Alexis, and David. When she was a child, her parents offered to get her braces for her teeth; but she refused, telling them she wanted to have flaws because it would help her with character acting.</p>\r\n<p>For a time her family lived on a commune in rural Bentonville, Virginia. She has said they became poorer the longer they lived there and she believes that experience enlarged her empathy. Their father was an alcoholic, and their mother violently abusive. When Arquette was seven, the family relocated to Chicago. They later settled in Los Angeles, California. Arquette grew up Catholic and attended Catholic school, and has said that when she was a teenager, she had wanted to be a nun. At the age of fourteen, Arquette ran away from home after learning her father was having an affair-she settled with her sister, Rosanna Arquette, in Los Angeles. She has described her father as a working actor for industrial films, commercials and voiceovers - he was best known for his role as J.D. Pickett in the TV series <i>The Waltons</i>. Before pursuing a career in acting, Arquette had wanted to be a midwife. She put this career prospect aside briefly in an attempt to gain acting jobs and gained success in the industry.</p>\r\n<p>In 1987, Arquette\'s first starring roles included pregnant teenager Stacy in the television film <i>Daddy</i>, boarding school student Zero in <i>Pretty Smart</i>, and Kristen Parker in <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</i>, alongside Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. She reprised her role as Kristen in the music video to Dokken\'s <i>Dream Warriors</i> (1987). She was asked to reprise her role in the sequel, <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master</i> (1988), but she declined the offer in order to do other projects. She gave up the role of Tralala in <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> due to her pregnancy with her son Enzo.</p>\r\n<p>In 1988, Arquette played the daughter of Tess Harper in <i>Far North</i>. Her roles in the early 1990s were in low budget and independent films, including <i>Prayer of the Rollerboys</i> (1990), <i>The Indian Runner</i> (1991), which was the directorial debut of Sean Penn; and the drama <i>Inside Monkey Zetterland</i>. In 1992, she won a CableACE Award for Best Lead Actress in a Mini-Series for her portrayal of a deaf girl with epilepsy in <i>Wildflower</i>, directed by Diane Keaton and also starring Reese Witherspoon.</p>\r\n<p>In her early career, Arquette received the most recognition for her role as Alabama Whitman, a free-spirited, kind-hearted prostitute in Tony Scott\'s <i>True Romance</i> (1993). The film was a moderate box office success but became a cultural landmark because of Quentin Tarantino\'s screenplay, which preceded <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, although some critics were deterred by the graphic violence. In one scene, Arquette puts up a fierce physical struggle in a fight with James Gandolfini (as a viciously sadistic killer) which her character ultimately wins. Arquette\'s performance received generally unanimous praise from critics. Janet Maslin of <i>The New York Times</i> premarked that Arquette played her role with \"surprising sweetness\", while Peter Travers remarked that \"Arquette delivers sensationally\". <i>TV Guide</i> noted that the film blends and recycles elements from the story of <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> and Terrence Malick\'s \"love on the run\" film <i>Badlands</i> (1973). It gave <i>True Romance</i> overall a favourable review for having \"enough energy and verve to create something entirely fresh and infectiously entertaining\". Richard Corliss of <i>Time Magazine</i> made similar statements and also likened the film to the earlier, seminal <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Arquette next appeared in the television film <i>Betrayed by Love</i> (1994), and the well-received biopic <i>Ed Wood</i>, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, where she portrayed his girlfriend. Her next role was as Laura Bowman in John Boorman\'s <i>Beyond Rangoon</i> (1995), which drew mixed critical reviews, but was a success internationally. In France, it was the official selection at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, where it became one of the most popular hits of the event. Although the film had lackluster reviews, Arquette\'s performance as an American tourist in Burma during the 8888 Uprising was regarded as one of the work\'s strong points. Michael Sragow, writing for <i>The New Yorker</i>, stated \"Arquette gives the kind of mighty physical performance usually delivered by men in existential action classics like \"The Wages of Fear,\" but she suffuses it with something all her own - she\'s bulletproof yet vulnerable.\" Hal Hinson of <i>The Washington Post</i> remarked that the film was \"odd, brilliant in places, but frustrating all the same,\" commenting that \"Arquette shows real grit when the chips are down\".</p>\r\n<p>Arquette appeared in three films in 1996, the first the comedy film <i>Flirting with Disaster</i> (1996), about a young man\'s cross-country pursuit to find his parents. Critical reception was largely positive, with Todd McCarthy of <i>Variety</i> praising the film and the authenticity of Arquette\'s performance, highlighting that \"Arquette [is] very believably distracted and infuriated\". <i>Flirting with Disaster</i> grossed $14 million at the American box office and was screened in the <i>Un Certain Regard</i> section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Her second film released that year was the period drama <i>The Secret Agent</i>, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad\'s 1907 novel of the same name. The film received average reviews. <i>Infinity</i> was her third film that year, a biographical drama about the early life of American physicist Richard Feynman. The film received mixed to positive reviews. Although Emmanuel Levy of <i>Variety</i> said that Arquette was \"miscast\", he stated that she \"registers more credibly in the first part of the film, when she plays an adolescent\".</p>\r\n<p>In 1997, Arquette starred in David Lynch\'s neo-noir psychological thriller <i>Lost Highway</i>, in dual roles as Renee Madison and Alice Wakefield. The film had an ambiguous narrative, which polarized audiences and drew varying critical opinion, but it established a strong cult following. Arquette played an elusive femme fatale in a critically revered performance that enabled her to draw on her sexuality more than any other previous role. Owen Gleiberman, writing for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> noted that \"Arquette, with her \'40s-style curves, is certainly a spellbinding temptress\". Roger Ebert, of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, disliked the film, saying there was \"no sense to be made of it\" and voiced his distaste over a scene in which Arquette\'s character is asked to disrobe at gunpoint. Other critics were more favourable: Andy Klein of the <i>Dallas Observer</i> called it a \"two-hour plus fever dream\", Michael Sragow of <i>The New Yorker</i> called the film a \"compelling erotic nightmare\", and Edward Guthman of the <i>San Francisco Gate</i> wrote a glowing review praising Arquette\'s performance, calling it the \"strongest, most memorable performance [of the film]\" and favourably comparing her double role to Kim Novak\'s in <i>Vertigo</i> (1958). That same year, Arquette appeared in <i>Nightwatch</i>, a horror-thriller film directed by Ole Bornedal. The film is a remake the Danish film <i>Nattevagten</i> (1994), which was also directed by Bornedal. <i>Nightwatch</i> was not a box office success and received poor reviews by critics, many of whom considered it an unnecessary, inferior retelling of the original film.</p>\r\n<p>1998 saw Arquette perform in two films: <i>Goodbye Lover</i>, a comedic neo-noir directed by Roland Joffé and <i>The Hi-Lo Country</i>, a period Western directed by Stephen Frears. The former received a poor critical reception while the latter received a more appreciative albeit modest response. <i>The Hi-Lo Country</i> was widely cited as a \"classic Western\" in the press. Stephen Holden of the New York Times said, \"In its best moments the movie feels like an epic hybrid of Red River and The Last Picture Show.\" In 1999, Arquette returned to familiar territory with the genre that began her career, in <i>Stigmata</i>, a horror film, in the lead role. Produced on a budget of $29 million, the film was a box office success, grossing $50,046,268. Internationally the film earned $39,400,000 for a total worldwide gross $89,446,268. Critics were not as receptive of the film as audiences, with Roger Ebert remarking \"possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism - from a theological point of view\". Arquette then appeared in Martin Scorsese\'s <i>Bringing out the Dead</i>, based on the novel by Joe Connelly. The film united her with then-husband Nicolas Cage and received highly favourable critical reviews, but was a box office flop. Janet Maslin of the <i>New York Times</i> wrote that \"Arquette\'s quietly credible performance helps center Frank\'s experiences; one of the film\'s most honest scenes is one in which they share an ambulance ride without sharing a word\".</p>\r\n<p>Her next role was in the light-hearted comedy <i>Little Nicky</i> (2000), alongside Adam Sandler. Despite being a box office hit, the film received negative reviews, although Roger Ebert called it Sandler\'s best film to date. Following this, she starred in French-American comedy drama <i>Human Nature</i> (2001), written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry. The film was met with mixed reviews and was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Roger Ebert, in a three-star (out of a possible four) review, lauded the film\'s \"screwball charm\". The following year, she appeared in the small-scale mystery film <i>The Badge</i>, playing the widowed victim of a murdered transsexual. In 2003, she portrayed the controversial pornographic film star Linda Lovelace in the little known <i>Deeper than Deep</i>, which was followed with the more family orientated Disney produced <i>Holes</i>, as Kissin\' Kate Barlow. Based on the 1998 novel of the same title by Louis Sachar, <i>Holes</i> grossed $16,300,155 in its opening weekend, making #2 at the box office, behind <i>Anger Management</i>\'s second weekend. <i>Holes</i> would go on to gross a domestic total of $67,406,173 and an additional $4 million in international revenue, totaling $71,406,573 at the box office against a $20 million budget, making the film a moderate financial success. Arquette\'s next film, <i>Tiptoes</i>, was released straight-to-DVD in the United States, despite a screening at the Sundance Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>After the humdrum reception of <i>Tiptoes</i>, Arquette did not appear in another film until 2006\'s <i>Fast Food Nation</i>, directed by Richard Linklater. During this three years, she was largely working on <i>Boyhood</i>; it was released eight years later in July 2014. <i>Fast Food Nation</i> marked her second collaboration with Linklater; it is based on the bestselling 2001 non-fiction book of the same name by Eric Schlosser. <i>Fast Food Nation</i> received mixed to positive critical reviews. Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> awarded the film three out of four stars and added, \"It\'s less an expose of junk-food culture than a human drama, sprinkled with sly, provoking wit, about how that culture defines how we live ... The film is brimming with grand ambitions but trips on many of them as some characters aren\'t given enough screen time to register and others vanish just when you want to learn more about them.\" A. O. Scott of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote \"It\'s a mirror and a portrait, and a movie as necessary and nourishing as your next meal.\"</p>\r\n<p>In January 2005, Arquette made her first transition to television with NBC\'s <i>Medium</i>. Her role as (a fictional version of) psychic medium Allison DuBois won her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2005, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe in 2005, 2006 and 2007, a SAG Award in 2006, 2007 and 2010, and an Emmy Award in 2007. In 2009 NBC cancelled <i>Medium</i>, then CBS picked the series up and it lasted another two seasons. In 2008, she provided voice work for <i>A Single Woman</i>, which was panned. She did not appear in another film until 2012. <i>Girl in Progress</i>, a drama directed by Patricia Riggen, marked her return; it was met with negative reviews. In 2013, she returned to television, appearing on <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> as Sally Wheet. Also in 2013, Arquette filmed the true crime drama <i>Electric Slide</i>, which is still awaiting release.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, <i>Boyhood</i> was released, a project that Arquette and other actors had shot for 12 years beginning in 2002. The film was directed by Richard Linklater, marking his second collaboration with Arquette. In the film, she plays Olivia Evans, a single mother who raises her two children mostly alone with the sometimes assistance of their father (played by Ethan Hawke). The epic explores a 12-year scope. The film details the progression of her character\'s son, Mason, from ages 8 to 18. The film has received universal praise, with many critics calling it a \"landmark film\". Arquette received widespread acclaim for her performance. Critic Katie McDonahugh, writing for <i>Salon</i>, states \"the role gave [Arquette] space to be all of these messy things at once, and her performance was a raw, gutsy meditation on those profoundly human contradictions\". Margaret Pomeranz, writing for <i>ABC Australia</i>, called Arquette\'s performance \"stunning\" and praised the film, further remarking that \"the elision from one time to another is subtle and seamless. It\'s just a fabulous movie experience\". Arquette won the Academy, BAFTA, Critics\' Choice, Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, and SAG Awards for Best Supporting Actress.</p>\r\n<p>In early 2015, Arquette began starring in the CBS series <i>CSI: Cyber</i>, a show about FBI agents who combat Internet-based crimes. On May 12, 2016, CBS canceled the series after two seasons, thus ending the <i>CSI</i> franchise.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, it was announced that Arquette would be starring in the Hulu series <i>The Act</i>. She portrayed Tilly Mitchell in the Showtime miniseries <i>Escape at Dannemora</i>, which premiered on November 18, 2018. For the role, she gained weight, wore prosthetic teeth, and brown contact lenses.</p>', 'actors/patricia-arquette_Cover.jpg'),

(60, 'Peter', '', 'Dinklage', 'M', '<p>Peter Hayden Dinklage was born on June 11, 1969, in Morristown, New Jersey, to John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman, and Diane Dinklage, an elementary-school music teacher. He was born with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Dinklage grew up as the only dwarf in his family in the historic Brookside section of Mendham Township, New Jersey, with his parents and older brother, Jonathan. His older brother Jonathan Dinklage graduated from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University and is a violinist for the play Hamilton. He is of German and Irish descent. As a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people in their neighborhood. Dinklage has described his brother Jonathan, who is a violinist, as being the \"real performer of the family,\" saying that his brother\'s passion for the violin was the only thing that kept him from pursuing acting.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage had his first theatrical success in a fifth-grade production of <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i>. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience\'s response to the show. Dinklage attended Delbarton School, a Catholic preparatory school for boys, where he developed his acting. In 1984, Dinklage was inspired by a production of the play <i>True West</i>, written by American playwright Sam Shepard, to pursue a career in acting.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage then attended Bennington College, where he studied for a drama degree and also appeared in numerous productions before graduating in 1991. After that he moved to New York City with his friend Ian Bell to build a theater company. Failing to pay the rent, they moved out of their apartment. (He lived in New York for twenty years in Williamsburg and the West Village). Dinklage then worked at a data processing company for six years before pursuing a career as a full-time actor.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage initially struggled to find work as an actor, partially because he refused to take the roles typically offered to actors with his condition, such as \"elves or leprechauns.\" He made his credited film debut in the low-budget independent comedy-drama <i>Living in Oblivion</i> (1995) where he performed alongside Steve Buscemi. The film tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. Dinklage\'s role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles. The film has been well received by critics. The following year he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama <i>Bullet</i> starring rapper Tupac Shakur. Even after his well-received performance in <i>Living in Oblivion</i>, Dinklage still could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to the director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy <i>13 Moons</i> (2002). When later interviewed for a theater website, he was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied \"the romantic lead\" who gets the girl.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage found his breakthrough playing Finbar McBride, who is a quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film <i>The Station Agent</i>. According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind, Cannavale said McCarthy \"set out to tell a story about a guy who was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world,\" but when McCarthy actually started \"putting pen to paper\" for the screenplay he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually \"roles written for someone my size are a little flat\"-often either comical or \"sort of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>\" type characters filled with wisdom; further: \"They\'re not sexual, they\'re not romantic\" and \"they\'re not flawed.\" What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has \"romantic feelings\" as well as \"anger and ... flaws.\" The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the <i>New York Observer</i>, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, \"Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face.\" Besides being Dinklage\'s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, <i>The Station Agent</i> was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage later appeared in the direct-to-DVD film <i>Tiptoes</i> (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman\'s role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was \"gorgeous,\" but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a \"rom-com with dwarves.\" Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, \"There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That\'s almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It\'s Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I\'m so happy to be here.\"</p>\r\n<p>That year, Dinklage also starred in several Off-Broadway productions, such as <i>Richard III</i>. Dinklage appeared in the Christmas comedy film <i>Elf</i> as Miles Finch, an irritable children\'s author who beats up Buddy Hobbs (Will Ferrell) after he mistakes him for an elf. In 2005, he starred in the short-lived CBS science fiction series <i>Threshold</i> and appeared as a wedding planner in the comedy film <i>The Baxter</i>. He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama <i>Lassie</i> as a traveling circus performer. The film received highly positive reviews, though it did not fare well at the box office.</p>\r\n<p>In 2006, Dinklage co-starred with Vin Diesel in <i>Find Me Guilty</i>, a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the true story of the longest Mafia trial in American history; Dinklage played Ben Klandis, the lead defense attorney. Critical reaction to the film was mostly positive, though it was a commercial failure. Writing for <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, film critic Roger Ebert praised Dinklage\'s performance, saying that the character he plays stands apart as \"concise, articulate and professional.\" The same year, he portrayed the character Marlowe Sawyer in episodes of <i>Nip/Tuck</i>. He played a fictionalized version of himself in an episode of the HBO series <i>Entourage</i> and appeared in NBC\'s <i>30 Rock</i> as Stewart. The same year, Dinklage appeared in the British romantic comedy <i>Penelope</i> playing Lemon, a tabloid reporter. The film received mixed reviews from critics.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage appeared in the 2007 British comedy film <i>Death at a Funeral</i>, reprising the role in the 2010 American remake; the films tell the story of a family trying to deal with a variety of issues after the death of their father. Later in 2007, he played the villainous Simon Bar Sinister in <i>Underdog</i>, which was poorly received but had some commercial success.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film <i>The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</i>. The film was a box office disappointment, with global revenues of $419.7 million, and film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage\'s role as a \"cutesy stereotype he has tried to avoid.\" Later that year, he played the title role in <i>Uncle Vanya</i> (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College\'s annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus. In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie <i>I Love You Too</i> alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2011, Dinklage has portrayed Tyrion Lannister in HBO\'s fantasy drama <i>Game of Thrones</i>, an adaptation of author George R. R. Martin\'s <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> novels. <i>Game of Thrones</i> takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, and uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life. In May 2009, he was the first actor to be cast, as showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss noted that Dinklage, whom he described as funny, smart and witty, was their first choice for the role, as the actor\'s \"core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.\" Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, \"he wouldn\'t play elves or leprechauns\" and was choosy about genre roles. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was \"a different kind of fantasy little person,\" or in the actor\'s words, \"No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.\" Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because, he said, \"They told me how popular he was.\" Martin said of Dinklage\'s casting, \"If he hadn\'t accepted the part, oh, boy, I don\'t know what we would have done.\" The series proved to be a commercial success; it has been renewed for multiple seasons and is about to conclude with its eighth season in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage has received widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from <i>The Boston Globe</i> saying that Dinklage \"gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.\" Dan Kois of <i>The New York Times</i> noted that Dinklage\'s performance has made the character \"all the more popular.\" The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote \"In many ways, <i>Game of Thrones</i> belongs to Dinklage.\" Tyrion has been called the \"most quotable\" character and \"one of the most beloved characters\" of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011, 2015, and 2018, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series\' second season. In 2014, he said on <i>The Late Show with David Letterman</i> that he had once tried to read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, \"George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that.\" In 2014, Dinklage and four of his <i>Game of Thrones</i> co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors\' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in <i>Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series</i>, a video game based on the show.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, Dinklage voiced Captain Gutt in <i>Ice Age: Continental Drift</i>, which earned over $877 million. Dinklage has said that because this was his first voiceover role, he prepared himself by making sure to rest his voice before the recording sessions, and that he prefers doing roles he has not done before. After appearing in an episode of NBC\'s late-night sketch comedy <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in 2013, Dinklage hosted an episode of the show in April 2016; his appearances included a sketch of him and Gwen Stefani singing a new song called \"Space Pants.\" He received praise for his performance.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, Dinklage starred in the comedy horror film <i>Knights of Badassdom</i> opposite Ryan Kwanten and Steve Zahn. The film is about three best friends that go to the woods and reenact a live action <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> role play, when they mistakenly conjure up a demon from Hell. The same year, he played the villain Bolivar Trask in the superhero film <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i>. The movie was the sixth highest-grossing film of 2014 with global revenues of $747.9 million. In preparation for his role, Dinklage stated that he did not want to approach the character necessarily as a villain, saying that Trask \"actually sees what he\'s doing as a good thing.\" He also voiced the AI Ghost in the 2014 video game <i>Destiny</i>, but was replaced by Nolan North in August 2015.</p>\r\n<p>In 2015, Dinklage starred in the science fiction comedy film <i>Pixels</i> as a former arcade champion named Eddie Plant, which was poorly received by critics. The movie had a global revenues of $244.9 million. In 2016, Dinklage provided the voice of The Mighty Eagle in <i>The Angry Birds Movie</i>, and recorded a song for the musical\'s soundtrack. The film went on to become the second highest-grossing video game film of all-time, with a global revenues of $349.8 million, only behind <i>Warcraft</i> ($433.5 million). It also became the most successful Finnish film to date. His next release, the independent film <i>Rememory</i> (2017), failed to impress reviewers, but his role of Sam Bloom was praised. Freelance film critic Yasmin Kleinbart stated that \"Dinklage deserves better than this film\" and John DeFore in <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> said that he \"delivers a soulful lead performance that will attract fans\' attention.\" Also in 2017, Dinklage had a supporting role in the drama-dark comedy film <i>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</i>, from director Martin McDonagh, and the drama <i>Three Christs</i>, both of which played at the Toronto International Film Festival, with the former receiving widespread critical success. In 2018, Dinklage produced and starred in <i>I Think We\'re Alone Now</i>, a post-apocalyptic drama based on the companionship between Del, played by Dinklage, and Grace, played by Elle Fanning. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and was later released to theaters on September 14, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage appeared in the 2018 Marvel Studios film <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> as the character Eitri, a giant dwarf, which became the fastest-grossing film to gross over $1 billion, and grossed $2.045 billion-his highest grossing release as of 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Dinklage and writer-director Sacha Gervasi spent several years writing and producing a film based on the final days of actor Hervé Villechaize, who died by suicide shortly after his 1993 interview with Gervasi. In 2018, Dinklage starred and played the title role in <i>My Dinner with Hervé</i>. The movie was approved by HBO, with Dinklage co-starring alongside Jamie Dornan.</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, it was announced that Dinklage has been attached to star in the American comedy <i>O Lucky Day</i>, which is to be directed by Jon S. Baird where he will play a con-man who pretends to be a Leprechaun.</p>\r\n<p>On October 5, 2017, Dinklage purchased the rights to the film adaptation of Joe R.

(62, 'Rami', '', 'Malek', 'M', '<p>He is the first actor of Egyptian heritage to win the Academy Award for Best Actor. <i>Time</i> magazine named Malek one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Rami Said Malek was born in Los Angeles, on May 12, 1981, to Egyptian immigrant parents, Said Malek and Nelly Abdel-Malek. He has said he is also \"an eighth Greek\". His parents left Cairo in 1978 after his father, a tour guide, became intrigued with Western visitors. They settled in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, mostly staying in the San Fernando Valley and rarely venturing into Hollywood. His father sold insurance; his mother is an accountant. Malek was raised in his family\'s Coptic Orthodox Christian faith, and grew up speaking colloquial Egyptian Arabic at home until the age of four. Malek has an identical twin brother named Sami who is younger by four minutes; he is an ESL and English teacher. Malek\'s older sister, Yasmine, is an ER doctor. His parents emphasized to their children the importance of preserving their Egyptian roots, and his father would wake his son in the middle of the night to talk to his Arabic-speaking extended family in their hometown of Samalut, Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>As a first-generation American, Malek found it difficult to assimilate as a child because of cultural differences, even spending most of his childhood having his name mispronounced: \"It only took me till high school where I found the confidence to tell everybody, no, my name is Rami. It\'s a very upsetting thing to think about, that I didn\'t have the confidence to correct anyone at that point\". As a result, he said it was difficult to form a self-identity as a child and gravitated towards \"creating characters and doing voices\" as he searched for an outlet for that energy. He attended Notre Dame High School, and was in the same class as actress Rachel Bilson. Kirsten Dunst, who is a year younger, also attended the school, and the two shared a musical theater class. His parents harbored dreams of his becoming a lawyer, so he joined the debate team. Though he struggled to form arguments, his debate teacher noted his talent in dramatic interpretation and encouraged him instead to perform the one-man play <i>Zooman and The Sign</i> at a competition. Reflecting on the moment, he said, \"On stage I\'m having this moment with my dad with a bunch of other people [in the audience], but then I thought, wow, something really special is happening here\". It was the first time he saw his father become emotional, and his parents\' positive reaction to his performance left him feeling free to pursue an acting career.</p>\r\n<p>After graduating in 1999, he went on to study theater at the University of Evansville in Evansville, Indiana, where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003. The college later honored Malek with a 2017 Young Alumnus Award, \"given to those who have achieved personal success and contribute services to their community and to UE\".</p>\r\n<p>After his college graduation, Malek wanted to attend grad school for theater; however, with college debt growing, he moved to New York instead where he shared a one-bedroom apartment with friends who were also in the theater business. His network of friends included writers and directors. Together they performed their own plays around the city. While visiting his family in Los Angeles, he met casting director Mali Finn who convinced him to stay and look for work in Hollywood. After moving in with his parents, Malek worked delivering pizza and making falafel and shawarma sandwiches at a restaurant in Hollywood to make ends meet. Despite sending his resume to production houses, he found it difficult to get work as an actor, which led to bouts of depression and a loss of confidence. He considered getting a real estate license instead of pursuing an acting career.</p>\r\n<p>After a year and a half, he finally received a call from casting director Mara Casey. She asked to speak to his agent. When he confessed he did not have one, she told him to get one first. After having a pleasant conversation, however, Malek suggested they meet anyway. She agreed, and the meeting led to him getting his first role in the TV sitcom <i>Gilmore Girls</i> in 2004. That same year he voiced \"additional characters\" for the video game <i>Halo 2</i>, for which he was uncredited. In 2005, he received his Screen Actors Guild card for his work in two episodes of the Steven Bochco war drama <i>Over There</i>. Later that year, he appeared in an episode of <i>Medium</i> and was cast in the prominent recurring role of Kenny, on the Fox comedy series <i>The War at Home</i>. Kenny\'s \"coming out\" story earned accolades from GLAAD. In 2006, Malek made his feature film debut as Pharaoh Ahkmenrah in the comedy <i>Night at the Museum</i>. He reprised this role in the sequels <i>Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian</i> (2009) and <i>Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb</i> (2014). In the spring of 2007, he appeared on-stage as Jamie in the Vitality Productions theatrical presentation of Keith Bunin\'s <i>The Credeaux Canvas</i> at the Elephant Theatre in Los Angeles.</p>\r\n<p>Malek returned to television in 2010 in a recurring role as the suicide bomber Marcos Al-Zacar on the eighth season of the Fox series <i>24</i>. Growing weary of playing characters he called \"acceptable terrorists\", he instructed his agent to reject any role that painted Arabs or Middle Easterners in a \"bad light\". Later that year, he received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Corporal Merriell \"Snafu\" Shelton in the Emmy Award-winning HBO World War II mini-series <i>The Pacific</i>. After the intensity of filming <i>The Pacific</i>, he chose to leave Hollywood and lived briefly in Argentina, though he says it was unsuccessful and he has \"since found better ways of coping\". During the filming of <i>The Pacific</i>, Malek received a letter from executive producer Tom Hanks praising Malek\'s performance. Hanks would then cast him as college student Steve Dibiasi in the feature film <i>Larry Crowne</i>, released in July 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Those opportunities led to Malek securing supporting roles in a series of major films. In August 2010, it was announced that he had been cast as the \"Egyptian coven\" vampire, Benjamin, in <i>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2</i>. In 2013 he played Nate, a new employee at a group home for youths, in the indie film <i>Short Term 12</i>, opposite Brie Larson. He appeared in two Spike Lee films during this period, the 2012 remake of the South Korean film <i>Oldboy</i>, in a part that was trimmed significantly, and later in the crowdfunded picture <i>Da Sweet Blood of Jesus</i>. The two men have remained friends. He also had minor roles in <i>Battleship</i>, the Oscar-nominated <i>The Master</i>, and <i>Ain\'t Them Bodies Saints</i>. He appeared as Josh, one of the main characters in <i>Until Dawn</i>, a horror game released for the PlayStation 4 on August 25, 2015. He lent his voice and likeness to the character and was fully motion-captured for the game.</p>\r\n<p>Screenwriter Sam Esmail had auditioned over 100 actors to play the lead character of Elliot Alderson (a mentally unstable computer-hacker) for a show he was developing. Having failed to cast the part, he considered re-writing the character altogether. After seeing Malek\'s audition, however, Esmail said, \"It opened my eyes to who Elliot really was\". The resultant psychological drama, <i>Mr. Robot</i>, premiered on June 24, 2015, on the USA Network, with Malek in the lead role. To accurately portray the character, who suffers from mental and social disorders, he met with a psychiatrist. The role drew immediate praise from critics, with <i>USA Today</i> calling it his \"breakout performance\". <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called Malek\'s \"magnetic performance\" the \"best reason\" to watch the show. <i>Backstage</i> remarked that Malek \"anchored the drama\" and that his \"spin\" on the anti-hero trope \"promises a fresh direction for prestige TV\". His performance earned him nominations for the Dorian Award, Satellite Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award. He won the Critics\' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He was the first non-white actor to win an Emmy in that category since 1998. The show will conclude with its fourth season in 2019.</p>\r\n<p><i>Buster\'s Mal Heart</i>, the first movie in which Malek played a starring role, premiered in September 2016 at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. In it, Malek plays a man who leads two lives, one as Jonah and another as Buster. Casting him in the role before his success on <i>Mr. Robot</i>, the director, Sarah Adina Smith, said, \"I had no idea how huge and adored he would become\". Reviewing the actor\'s performance, John DeFore of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote, \"Fans of <i>Mr. Robot</i> won\'t be disappointed in the least by this vehicle for Emmy-winning series star Rami Malek, which both fits in with Mr. Robot\'s delusion-prone paranoia and lets the charismatic actor stretch out in his first feature lead\". Malek next starred as Louis Dega in <i>Papillon</i>, a remake of the 1973 film, co-starring Charlie Hunnam. It premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and had a limited box office release in August 2018. In 2017, Malek joined the cast of <i>Bojack Horseman</i> (season 4), voicing the character Flip McVicker, a writer who does not trust email.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Malek portrayed Freddie Mercury in the Queen biopic, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>. The film premiered in London on October 23, 2018, and became a major box office success, grossing over $900 million worldwide on a production budget of about $50 million. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide, and the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all-time. Despite mixed reviews for the film itself, Malek\'s performance received critical acclaim. He won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. To prepare for the role as Mercury, Malek moved to London where he employed a dialect coach and movement coach, and took piano and singing lessons. For four hours each day, he studied videos of Mercury with his movement coach, Polly Bennett. This included watching the 1985 Live Aid concert video on YouTube at least 1,500 times to perfect his performance for the movie. He also had to get used to singing and speaking with a set of false teeth that mimicked the singer\'s overbite. Brian May, Queen\'s guitarist who often attended filming, is quoted as saying that Malek\'s performance was so accurate that \"we sometimes forgot he was Rami\".</p>\r\n<p>During the press tour for <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>, Malek said he is working on a movie, one he plans to write, direct, and produce himself on a small budget, since it is a story that he says \"might get passed on by studios looking for something a bit more broad and commercial\". In December 2018, it was announced that Malek would produce and star in an eight-episode podcast called <i>Blackout</i>. Scott Conroy is the writer of the upcoming podcast, a thriller about a small-town radio DJ who must \"fight to protect his family and community from a coordinated attack that destroys the power grid and upends modern civilization\". The podcast debuted with two episodes on March 19, 2019, with six subsequent episodes premiering weekly. On April 25, 2019, Malek was confirmed as the villain in the upcoming James Bond film, which has a release date of April 2020.</p>', 'actors/rami-malek_cover.jpg'),

(66, 'Sam', '', 'Rockwell', 'M', '<p>Sam Rockwell was born November 5, 1968 in Daly City, California. He is the only child of actors Pete Rockwell and Penny Hess. After their divorce when he was five, he was raised by his father in San Francisco, and spent his summers with his mother in New York. At age 10, he made a brief stage appearance playing Humphrey Bogart in an East Village improv comedy sketch with his mother.</p>\r\n<p>He started high school at the San Francisco School of the Arts with Margaret Cho and Aisha Tyler, but received his high school diploma from Urban Pioneers, an Outward Bound-style alternative school. Rockwell explained, \"I just wanted to get stoned, flirt with girls, go to parties.\" The school \"had a reputation as a place stoners went because it was easy to graduate.\" The school ended up helping him regain an interest in performing. After appearing in an independent film during his senior year, he moved to New York to pursue an acting career.</p>\r\n<p>After his debut role in the horror film <i>Clownhouse</i> (1989) (produced by Francis Ford Coppola\'s production company), which he filmed while living in San Francisco, he moved to New York and trained at the William Esper Studios with teacher Terry Knickerbocker. His career slowly gained momentum in the early 1990s, when he alternated between small-screen guest spots in TV series like <i>The Equalizer</i>, <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i> and small roles in films such as <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> and <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>. He also appeared as the title character in <i>The Search for One-eye Jimmy</i> (1994). During this time, Rockwell worked in restaurants as a busboy and delivered burritos by bicycle. At one point, Rockwell even worked as a private detective\'s assistant. \"I tailed a chick who was having an affair and took pictures of her at this motel\", he told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2002. \"It was pretty sleazy.\" A well-paying Miller commercial in 1994 finally allowed him to pursue acting full-time.</p>\r\n<p>The turning point in Rockwell\'s career was Tom DiCillo\'s film <i>Box of Moonlight</i> (1996), in which he played an eccentric man-child who dresses like Davy Crockett and lives in an isolated mobile home. The ensuing acclaim put him front and center with casting agents and newfound fans alike, with Rockwell himself acknowledging that \"That film was definitely a turning point...I was sort of put on some independent film map after 10 years in New York.\"</p>\r\n<p>He also received strong reviews for the film <i>Lawn Dogs</i> (1997), where he played a working-class lawn mower who befriends a wealthy 10-year-old girl (Mischa Barton) in an upper-class gated community in Kentucky; Rockwell\'s performance won him Best Actor honors at both the Montreal World Film Festival and the Catalan International Film Festival. In 1999, Rockwell played prisoner William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton in the Stephen King prison drama <i>The Green Mile</i>. At the time of the film\'s shooting, Rockwell explained why he was attracted to playing such unlikable characters. He said, \"I like that dark stuff. I think heroes should be flawed. There\'s a bit of self-loathing in there, and a bit of anger... But after this, I\'ve really got to play some lawyers, or a British aristocrat, or they\'ll put a label on me.\"</p>\r\n<p>After appearances as a bumbling actor in the sci-fi parody <i>Galaxy Quest</i> (1999), as Flute in the Shakespeare adaptation <i>A Midsummer Night\'s Dream</i> (1999), and as gregarious villain Eric Knox in <i>Charlie\'s Angels</i> (2000), Rockwell won the then-biggest leading role of his career as <i>The Gong Show</i> host Chuck Barris in George Clooney\'s directorial debut, <i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i> (2002). Rockwell\'s performance was well-received, and the film earned generally positive reviews.</p>\r\n<p>Rockwell has also received positive notices for his role opposite Nicolas Cage in Ridley Scott\'s <i>Matchstick Men</i> (2003), with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> calling him \"destined by a kind of excessive interestingness to forever be a colorful sidekick.\" He received somewhat more mixed reviews as Zaphod Beeblebrox in the film version of <i>The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy</i> (2005). He then had a notable supporting role as Charley Ford, brother of Casey Affleck\'s character Robert Ford, in the well-received drama <i>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i> (2007), in which Brad Pitt played the lead role of Jesse James. According to an interview on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i>, director Jon Favreau considered casting him as the titular character in <i>Iron Man</i> as the studio was initially hesitant to work with Robert Downey Jr., who had been considered for his role in <i>The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. Rockwell eventually appeared in <i>Iron Man 2</i>, released in 2010, as Tony Stark\'s rival weapons developer, Justin Hammer. He is said to have accepted the role without reading the script. He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the role and was unaware that Hammer is an old man in the comic books.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to big-budget feature films, Rockwell has also appeared in indie films such as <i>The F Word</i> and played a randy, Halloween-costume-clad Batman in a short, <i>Robin\'s Big Date</i>, opposite Justin Long as Robin. He also starred in the film <i>Snow Angels</i> (2008) opposite Kate Beckinsale. He has worked on several occasions with the comedy troupe Stella (Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain), making cameo appearances in their short films and eponymous TV series.</p>\r\n<p>Rockwell played Victor Mancini in the film <i>Choke</i> (2008), based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Critic Roger Ebert said of his performance that he \"seems to have become the latter-day version of Christopher Walken - not all the time, but when you need him, he\'s your go-to guy for weirdness.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 2007, Rockwell guest-starred in the web series <i>Casted: The Continuing Chronicles of Derek Riffchyn, Greatest Casting Director in the World. Ever.</i> He appears opposite Jonathan Togo as Derek and Justin Long as Scott. Rockwell plays an aspiring young actor named Pete Sampras. In 2009, he starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film <i>Moon</i>, directed by Duncan Jones.

On May 3, 2010, it was announced that Rockwell would team up again with <i>Iron Man 2</i> director Jon Favreau for Favreau\'s adaptation of the graphic novel <i>Cowboys & Aliens</i>. He played a bar owner named Doc who joins in the pursuit of the aliens.</p>\r\n<p>Rockwell also appeared in Martin McDonagh\'s <i>Seven Psychopaths</i> (2012), as well as Nat Faxon and Jim Rash\'s <i>The Way, Way Back</i> (2013). For his performance in <i>The Way, Way Back</i>, some critics felt he again deserved an Academy Award nomination.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2014, it was announced that Rockwell was cast in <i>The Eel</i>, in which he played an escaped convict. The film was produced by Kevin Walsh, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash, marking Rockwell\'s second collaboration with all three. Additionally, Rockwell starred in the 2015 remake of <i>Poltergeist</i>. On May 3, 2016, it was announced that Rockwell would voice Mortimer Ramsey in the action video game <i>Dishonored 2</i>. Rockwell was cast along with other Marvel Cinematic Universe actors.</p>\r\n<p>Rockwell re-teamed with McDonagh for the 2017 film <i>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</i>. His performance as a racist, bullying police officer Jason Dixon won several accolades, including his first Academy Award, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In August 2017, Rockwell was cast to play George W. Bush in Adam McKay\'s <i>Vice</i>, a biopic of Dick Cheney; he received his second nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award as a result.</p>', 'actors/sam-rockwell_Cover.jpg');

She spent her early life living in South Tampa until her parents\' divorce when she was five years old. After her parents\' separation, Paulson relocated with her mother and sister to Maine, then to New York City. Her mother worked as a waitress, and Paulson lived in Queens and Gramercy Park, before settling in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She recalled of this period: \"My mom was 27 years old [when we moved]. She didn\'t know a single person in New York City. She got a job at Sardi\'s Restaurant... She was so brave to be basically a debutante in Tampa, Florida, having a cotillion and a coming out ball-and she picked up and brought her two kids to the greatest city in the world, not knowing anyone. My mom\'s kind of my hero that way.\"</p>\r\n<p>Throughout her childhood, Paulson spent her summers in Florida staying with her father, who was an executive at a Tampa door manufacturing company.

Leonard Klady of <i>Variety</i> noted that Paulson and her co-stars are \"not supported by the script,\" concluding: \"<i>Levitation</i> is a grim, convoluted saga of identity and belonging. An ill-fitting combination of melodrama and magic realism, the indie effort will have a decidedly difficult time in the theatrical arena.\" She also appeared Off-Broadway in a fall 1998 production of <i>Killer Joe</i>. She subsequently played Elisa Cronkite in The WB comedy-drama series <i>Jack & Jill</i> (1999). The same year, she was also cast opposite Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton in the drama <i>The Other Sister</i>, playing the lesbian sister of a developmentally-disabled woman in San Francisco, and in a supporting part playing a hostage in the comedy <i>Held Up</i>, opposite Jamie Foxx.

Reality never makes an appearance in this surreally blurred production.\" Later that year, Paulson appeared Off-Broadway in a production of <i>Colder Than Here</i>, opposite Lily Rabe (also her future co-star on <i>American Horror Story</i>). The production received an unfavorable review from <i>Variety</i>, with critic Dave Rooney writing: \"Rabe speaks in an affected monotone while Sarah Paulson has the measured, upward-inflected delivery of a children\'s TV presenter...  this mannered, melancholy play elicits a mainly impassive response, which is no small obstruction in a work dealing with loss.\"</p>\r\n<p>Also in 2005, Paulson had a small role in the Joss Whedon-directed science fiction film <i>Serenity</i>. In the 2006-07 television season, Paulson co-starred in NBC\'s <i>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</i>, playing Harriet Hayes, one of the stars of the show-within-a-show.

In a 2015 episode of <i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i> she discovered that her biological paternal grandfather was an American Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy stationed in Australia during World War II, whose name Toni does not know. From an early age, Collette showed a talent for acting. She faked appendicitis when she was eleven, and was so convincing that doctors removed her appendix, although tests showed nothing wrong with it.</p>\r\n<p>She attended Blacktown Girls\' High School until the age of 16, and later attended both the Australian Theatre for Young People and National Institute of Dramatic Art. Her first acting role was onstage in the musical <i>Godspell</i> in Sydney in her early teens.</p>\r\n<p>Collette made her television debut in 1990, in a guest appearance on the Seven Network drama series <i>A Country Practice</i>. In 1992, she made her feature film debut as part of the ensemble comedy-drama <i>Spotswood</i> (known in the U.S. as <i>The Efficiency Expert</i>), which starred Anthony Hopkins and which also featured Russell Crowe.

Collette was subsequently nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Actress for her performance of a successful-but-lonely lawyer with low self-esteem, which Mick LaSalle of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> noted the focus of the film: \"As usual, Collette\'s face is a fine-tuned transmitter of her emotions, moment by moment, and she becomes the locus of audience feeling.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 2006, Collette starred in <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, a comedy-drama-road movie about a family\'s trip to a children\'s beauty pageant. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2006, and its distribution rights were bought by Fox Searchlight Pictures for one of the biggest deals made in the history of the festival. Released in July 2006, the film received major critical acclaim, resulting in several accolades such as four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, whilst Collette herself earned her second BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for her portrayal of the family\'s worn-out matriarch.

The film earned positive reviews, with Collette receiving the bulk of the praise. <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote that the movie was \"centered by smart, soulful work by the wonderful Toni Collette\" and that she played the character of Ellie, \"with warmth, realness and emotional transparency that make you stay with her even when she\'s pushing people away.\" <i>Variety</i> said that \"it\'s Collette\'s show, and the actress fully conveys the brittle, hard-edged cynicism of someone who\'s been around the block a few times, jaded by years of exposure to the empty promises and broken dreams that proliferate on her chosen beat ... it generates a surprising degree of suspense as it barrels toward its final revelations, culminating in an unexpectedly emotional payoff played with piercing delicacy by Collette.\" The film played the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, where Joe Bendel of <i>Libertas Film Magazine</i> ranked Collette\'s leading performance as the fourth-best of the festival. Upon release, Mike D\'Angelo of <i>The Dissolve</i> wrote that \"Toni Collette is capable of anything\" and other raves came from <i>The Village Voice</i>, the <i>New York Post</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. <i>Lucky Them</i> received mixed reviews including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Slant</i> and <i>PopMatters</i>, though Collette\'s performance was consistently praised.

A rave review from <i>The New York Times</i> thought that \"Ms. Collette exudes a touching, exasperated dignity as Jennifer.\" <i>Variety</i> called her work \"terribly funny,\" while <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> claimed that \"Collette, whose naturalness can cut through even the very deliberate theatrical artifice of Eno\'s dialogue and scene construction, anchors the play with her somber restraint and deadpan delivery.\" The <i>New York Post</i>, more critical of the play, highlighted Collette\'s performance: \"Collette does some heavy lifting to fill in Eno\'s blanks. You can read deep sadness in the wide planes of her expressive face, in her lost, unfocused eyes.\" Other good reviews for the play and her performance came from <i>USA Today</i>, <i>Newsday</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and <i>The Economist</i>. Collette and her co-stars won a Drama Desk Special Award for Best Ensemble Performance.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, Collette starred in the badly received tragi-comedy <i>A Long Way Down</i>, with Pierce Brosnan and Aaron Paul.

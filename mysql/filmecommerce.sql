(11, 'Bill', '', 'Hader', 'M', '<p>William Thomas Hader Jr. was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Sherri Renee (née Patton) and William Thomas Hader. His father owned an air-freight company and worked as a restaurant manager, truck driver and occasional stand-up comedian; his mother was a dance teacher. He has two younger sister, Katie and Kara. His ancestry includes German, Danish, Irish, and English; his surname originates in Germany.</p>\r\n<p>Hader attended Patrick Henry Elementary School, Edison Junior High, and Cascia Hall Preparatory School. He had \"a hard time focusing on class\" and was always \"joking around\". Though he was not hated by classmates, he felt he never truly fit in and filled his time watching movies and reading. He appreciated Monty Python, British comedy, and the films of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, many of which he was introduced to through his father. He made short films with friends and starred in a school production of <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>.</p>\r\n<p>He was unable to gain admission to top film schools because of his \"abysmal\" grades, so he instead enrolled at The Art Institute of Phoenix, and later Scottsdale Community College. Hader has mentioned that his very first job was selling Christmas trees. He also worked as an usher at a movie theater in nearby Tempe, which allowed him to see films for free. He was fired for spoiling the ending of the 1997 film <i>Titanic</i> to noisy patrons. At Scottsdale, he met Nicholas Jasenovec, the director of <i>Paper Heart</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Hader\'s aspirations of becoming a filmmaker eventually led him to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles in 1999. His parents were supportive of his decision to move, and Hader used the money they had originally saved for his college education to cover his living expenses when he arrived in Los Angeles. He found work as a production assistant (PA) while scouring the back pages of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, and he hoped to advance far enough to become an assistant director. He spent much of his young adulthood \"lonely and underemployed,\" filling large amounts of spare time with movie marathons. He regularly worked 18-hour days as a PA, having little time to pursue his creative ambitions. He worked as a PA on the DVD <i>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</i>; the feature films <i>James Dean</i>, <i>Spider-Man</i>, and <i>Collateral Damage</i>; as well as a post-production assistant on VH1 television\'s <i>The Surreal Life</i>. Hader briefly worked as a PA and stage manager on Playboy TV\'s <i>Night Calls</i>; he quit, as he feared it would disappoint his parents. He quit being a PA altogether after a bad experience shooting <i>The Scorpion King</i>.</p>\r\n<p>He subsequently secured a job working as a nighttime assistant editor at post-production facility Triage Entertainment. He invested money into his own short film, but was too embarrassed to release it. Shortly thereafter, Hader and his then-longtime girlfriend broke up. Desperate for a change, he began attending comedy classes with friends at improvisational comedy enterprise the Second City in March 2003. He quickly realized that comedy was the creative outlet that he had needed since he made the decision to leave higher education behind, and soon Hader, his new compatriot in comedy Matt Offerman, and their two friends and fellow humor enthusiasts Eric Filipkowski and Mel Cowan, elected to form their own sketch comedy group. Christening their group <i>Animals from the Future</i>, the four frequently appeared to small audiences at backyard shows in Van Nuys. Matt\'s brother, actor Nick Offerman, told his wife, Megan Mullally, about the group. Mullally, her interest piqued, wanted to see their work personally and, after attending one of the group\'s backyard appearances, she informed Hader of her intention to discuss him, specifically, with Lorne Michaels, creator and executive producer of <i>Saturday Night Live (SNL)</i>. Hader, as a result of Mullally\'s recommendation, was asked to audition for the show, and soon flew to New York to audition for a group of <i>SNL</i> producers. Hader, who would later receive acclaim for his excellent impressions of others while appearing on <i>SNL</i>, had no impressions prepared when he was invited to audition. Despite being nervous and struggling to display his strengths during the audition, this resulted in his spontaneous imitation of an elderly Italian man he had once overheard; this impression would later become the first of Hader\'s many recurring characters on the show: Vinny Vedecci. As a result of the audition, Hader got an agent and manager. Just before he was officially invited to begin work on <i>SNL</i>, Hader was working as an assistant editor on <i>Iron Chef America</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After his film debut <i>You, Me and Dupree</i>, Hader had a wide range of roles such as Katherine Heigl\'s character\'s editor at E! in <i>Knocked Up</i>, the acid-taking mechanic Dave in <i>Hot Rod</i> alongside SNL castmate Andy Samberg, a recumbent biker in <i>The Brothers Solomon</i> (which featured SNL castmate Will Forte in one of the film\'s co-leading roles) and, most famously, as Officer Slater in the Judd Apatow produced Superbad.

Tom Fontana, executive producer of <i>Homicide</i>, cast Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of an injured police officer, after watching Falco\'s performance in <i>Laws of Gravity</i>, a 1992 film directed by Nick Gomez. Fontana said of her, \"She\'s an actress who\'s unadorned by any embroidery. She does everything with such simplicity and honesty, it\'s breathtaking.\" A struggling actress at the time, Falco said her salary from these television episodes paid for one month\'s worth of rent.</p>\r\n<p>Her first big break in films was a small speaking role in the 1994 Woody Allen film <i>Bullets over Broadway</i>. Her friendship with former SUNY Purchase classmate Eric Mendelsohn, who was the assistant to Allen\'s costume designer, Jeffrey Kurland, helped her to be cast in the role. Mendelsohn went on to direct Falco in his feature film <i>Judy Berlin</i>, for which he won Best Director honors at the Sundance Film Festival.

(27, 'Emma', '', 'Stone', 'F', '<p>The recipient of numerous accolades, including an Oscar, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award, she was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2017. Stone has appeared in <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100 in 2013 and 2017, and was featured by <i>Time</i> as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Emily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone (<i>née</i> Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company. Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15. She has a younger brother, Spencer. Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to \"Stone\" when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island. She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.</p>\r\n<p>As an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child. Stone has described herself as having been \"loud\" and \"bossy\" while growing up. She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that \"I made sure I got all As\". Stone suffered panic attacks as a child, which she says caused a decline in her social skills. She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.</p>\r\n<p>Stone started acting at age four; she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage production of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, playing the part of Otter. The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix\'s Valley Youth Theatre-including <i>The Princess and the Pea</i>, </i>Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and <i>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</i>-and performed with the theater\'s improvisational comedy troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon\'s <i>All That</i>. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>Stone attended Xavier College Preparatory?-?an all-girl Catholic high school?-?as a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress. She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled \"Project Hollywood\" (featuring Madonna\'s 2003 song \"Hollywood\") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career. In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalls: \"I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom\", adding, \"I ended up getting none.\" Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes, and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.</p>\r\n<p>When Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, the name \"Emily Stone\" was already taken. She initially chose to go by \"Riley Stone\", but after guest-starring in the NBC drama <i>Medium</i> and the Fox sitcom <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, she decided that she was more comfortable with \"Emma\". She chose to use \"Emma\" in honor of Emma Bunton, aka Baby Spice from the Spice Girls. She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show <i>In Search of the New Partridge Family</i> (2004). The resulting show, retitled <i>The New Partridge Family</i> (2004), remained an unsold pilot. She followed this with a guest appearance in Louis C.K.\'s HBO series <i>Lucky Louie</i>. She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama <i>Heroes</i> (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her \"rock bottom\" experience. In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama <i>Drive</i>, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.</p>\r\n<p>Stone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola\'s comedy <i>Superbad</i> (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill\'s romantic interest, she dyed her hair red. A reviewer for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> found her \"appealing\", but felt that her role was poorly written. Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as \"amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I\'ve had since then\". The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.</p>\r\n<p>The following year, Stone starred in the comedy <i>The Rocker</i> (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the \"straight face\" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as \"a big smiler and laugher\", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy <i>The House Bunny</i>, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses\' 1982 song \"I Know What Boys Like\". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and <i>TV Guide</i>\'s Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: \"She\'s positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her.\"</p>\r\n<p>Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters\' <i>Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</i>. Loosely based on Charles Dickens\' 1843 novella <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success. Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer\'s $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film <i>Zombieland</i>, in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which <i>Empire</i>\'s Chris Hewitt found to be \"somewhat underwritten\". In a more positive review, the critic for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> wrote: \"[T]he hugely promising Stone ... [is] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years.\" Stone\'s final release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney\'s <i>Paper Man</i>, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.</p>\r\n<p>Stone provided the voice of an Australian Shepherd in <i>Marmaduke</i> (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey, which is based on Brad Anderson\'s long-running comic strip of the same name. Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in <i>Easy A</i>, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck. Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne\'s 1850 historical romance novel <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script \"so different and unique from anything I\'d read before\", saying that it was \"funny and sweet\". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition. The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone\'s performance was considered its prime asset. Anna Smith of <i>Time Out</i> commented: \"Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth.\" With a total box office of $75 million, the film was a commercial success. Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC\'s late-night sketch comedy <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan. Stone described it as \"the greatest week of my life\". She hosted it again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015. A brief appearance in the sex comedy <i>Friends with Benefits</i> (2011) reunited her with Gluck. She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa\'s romantic comedy <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i> (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film features her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling\'s character. Despite finding \"some inevitable collapses into convention\" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone \"ties the whole film together\". At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress - Comedy award for her performance in the film. <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i> was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide with a production budget of $50 million.</p>\r\n<p>Disillusioned at being typecast as the \"sarcastic interest of the guy\", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor\'s period drama <i>The Help</i> (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett\'s 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: \"Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, \'God! God! This is Skeeter.\" She was cast as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, <i>The Help</i> became Stone\'s most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for <i>Empire</i>, Anna Smith thought that Stone was \"well-meaning and hugely likable\" despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.</p>\r\n<p>Stone declined a role in the action comedy film <i>21 Jump Street</i> after signing on to Marc Webb\'s 2012 film <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>, a reboot of Sam Raimi\'s <i>Spider-Man</i> series. She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the title character (played by Andrew Garfield). Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously. She told <i>The Vancouver Sun</i> that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\", adding that she was only familiar with Stacy\'s character from Bryce Dallas Howard\'s portrayal in <i>Spider-Man 3</i>. <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012 with global revenues of $757.9 million. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>\'s Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone \"irresistible\", and Ian Freer of <i>Empire</i> magazine was particularly impressed with Stone\'s and Garfield\'s performances. At the annual People\'s Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress. Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, <i>Sleeping Dogs</i>, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.</p>\r\n<p>Stone began 2013 with a voice role in DreamWorks\' <i>The Croods</i>, an animated feature nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. This followed with an appearance in <i>Movie 43</i>, an anthology film which consists of sixteen short stories-she played the title role in the segment entitled \"Veronica\". The actress collaborated with Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer\'s <i>Gangster Squad</i> (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s. <i>The New York Times</i>\' A. O. Scott dismissed the film as \"a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits\", but praised her pairing with Gosling. Stone expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>. In an interview with <i>Total Film</i>, the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film\'s protagonist. \"She saves him more than he saves her. She\'s incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He\'s the muscle, she\'s the brains.\" Her performance was well received by critics; an <i>Empire</i> reviewer praised her for standing out in the film: \"Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character.\" The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids\' Choice Awards. Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen\'s romantic comedy <i>Magic in the Moonlight</i>, a modest commercial success. A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as \"the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect\".</p>\r\n<p>The black comedy-drama <i>Birdman</i>, from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone\'s final film release in 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film features her in the role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter. <i>Birdman</i> was critically acclaimed, and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture. The Movie Network considered it one of Stone\'s best performances to date and Robbie Collin of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was \"like a knitting needle to the gut\". She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an Academy, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics\' Choice Movie award for Best Supporting Actress.</p>\r\n<p>From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical <i>Cabaret</i> as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams. Considering it to be \"the most nerve-racking thing ever\", Stone told the <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role. <i>Variety</i>\'s Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance \"a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy.\" Both of Stone\'s 2015 films?-?the romantic comedy-drama <i>Aloha</i>, and the mystery drama <i>Irrational Man?</i>-?were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics. In Cameron Crowe\'s <i>Aloha</i>, she took on the role of an air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in the Woody Allen-directed <i>Irrational Man</i>, she portrayed the romantic interest of Joaquin Phoenix\'s character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast, as Stone\'s character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood. Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress - Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. Stone would also in 2015 star in the music video for Win Butler\'s single \"Anna\"</p>\r\n<p>During her <i>Cabaret</i> show, Stone met director Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama <i>La La Land</i>. The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, featured Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles. Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i> and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. For the musical\'s soundtrack, she recorded six songs. <i>La La Land</i> served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and received highly positive reviews. Besides being Stone\'s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget. Writing for <i>The Guardian</i>, Peter Bradshaw reviewed, \"Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears.\" Stone received an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe and a SAG Award for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Stone\'s sole film release of 2017 was the sports drama <i>Battle of the Sexes</i>, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, trained with a dialect coach to speak in King\'s accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg). The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone\'s performance to be the best of her career. Benjamin Lee of <i>The Guardian</i> praised her for playing against type, and credited her for being \"strong\" and \"convincing\" in the part. Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget. Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Stone and Rachel Weisz starred as Abigail Masham and Sarah Churchill, two cousins fighting for the affection of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), in Yorgos Lanthimos\'s historical comedy-drama <i>The Favourite</i>. Stone found it challenging being an American among a British cast, and had difficulty in mastering the accent. The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August. Michael Nordine of IndieWire praised Stone for taking on a bold role after <i>La La Land</i>, and termed the three leading ladies \"a majestic triumvirate in a period piece that\'s as tragic as it is hilarious.\" For <i>The Favourite</i>, Stone received her fifth Golden Globe nomination and third Oscar nomination. That September, she featured in and served as an executive producer for the Netflix dark comedy miniseries <i>Maniac</i>, co-starring Jonah Hill and directed by Cary Fukunaga. Stone and Hill played two strangers, Annie Landsberg and Owen Milgrim, whose lives are transformed due to a mysterious pharmaceutical trial. An admirer of Fukunaga\'s work, Stone agreed to the project without reading the script. Lucy Mangan of <i>The Guardian</i> praised Stone and Hill for playing against type and for delivering career-best performances; Judy Berman of <i>Time</i> was similarly impressed with their growth as actors since <i>Superbad</i> and took note of the complexity in their performances. In the same year, Stone appeared alongside Paul McCartney in a music video for his song \"Who Cares\".</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Stone will next star in <i>Zombieland: Double Tap</i>, in the drama <i>Love May Fail</i>, based on Matthew Quick\'s 2015 novel, and in a live-action spin-off of <i>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</i> titled <i>Cruella</i>, directed by Craig Gillespie, in which she will portray Cruella de Vil (originally played by Glenn Close in the 1996 live-action adaptation).

Her adoptive mother was a nurse and receptionist while her adoptive father was a Disciples of Christ pastor; both were originally from Canada. McDormand has said that her biological mother, to whom she proudly referred, along with herself, as \"white trash,\" may have been one of the parishioners at Vernon\'s church. She has a sister, Dorothy A. \"Dot\" McDormand, who is an ordained Disciples of Christ minister and chaplain, as well as another sibling, both of whom were adopted by the McDormands, who had no biological children.</p>\r\n<p>Because her father specialized in restoring congregations, he frequently moved their family, and they lived in several small towns in Illinois, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, before settling in Monessen, Pennsylvania, where McDormand graduated from Monessen High School in 1975.

And since she is the film\'s sole voice of morality, it\'s right that she is so memorable.\" In 1996, she won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as a pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson in <i>Fargo</i>, written and directed by the Coen brothers. Writing for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, Roger Ebert called <i>Fargo</i> \"one of the best films I\'ve ever seen\" and felt that McDormand \"should have a lock on an Academy Award nomination with this performance, which is true in every individual moment, and yet slyly, quietly, over the top in its cumulative effect.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 2000, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her portrayal of an overbearing mother in <i>Almost Famous</i>.

Winkler has a sister named Beatrice.</p>\r\n<p>Winkler has said that he was very anxious as a child because of his undiagnosed dyslexia, and that he was considered to be \"slow, stupid, not living up to my potential\". He also said that his relationship with his parents was strained, due at least partially to their attitude towards his undiagnosed dyslexia. As his father spoke 11 languages and could do math in his head, he did not understand Winkler\'s problems at school, and why Winkler would celebrate a C grade. His father often said to him in German \"Du bist ein dummer Hund\", which means \"you are a dumb dog\" and often punished him for his difficulties in school.

She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and her mother brought her up to be \"tough\" like them. Karen did not allow her daughter to play with other girls in preschool as she deemed her \"too rough\" with them. Lawrence was educated at the Kammerer Middle School in Louisville. She did not enjoy her childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety and considered herself a misfit among her peers. Lawrence has said that her anxieties vanished when she performed on stage and that acting gave her a sense of accomplishment.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence\'s school activities included cheerleading, softball, field hockey and basketball, which she played on a boys\' team that was coached by her father.

When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. She had her first acting assignment at age nine when she played the role of a prostitute in a church play that was based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence was fourteen and on a family vacation in New York City when she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for talent agents.

After Lawrence\'s first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence\'s mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult because she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. While her mother encouraged her to go into modelling, Lawrence insisted on pursuing acting. At that time, she considered acting to be a natural fit for her abilities, and she turned down several offers for modeling assignments. Lawrence dropped out of school at age 14 without receiving a GED or a diploma. She has said that she was \"self-educated\" and that her career was her priority.

Mark Feeney for <i>The Boston Globe</i> thought of Lawrence\'s performance as \"a thankless task\", but Derek Elley from <i>Variety</i> praised her as the production\'s prime asset, writing that she \"plumbs fresher depths\" into the film. Her performance earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Emerging Actress at the Venice Film Festival. Also that year, she appeared in the music video for the song \"The Mess I Made\" by Parachute. The following year, she starred in Lori Petty\'s drama <i>The Poker House</i> as the oldest of three sisters living with a drug-abusing mother. Stephen Farber of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> thought that Lawrence \"has a touching poise on camera that conveys the resilience of children\", and her role in <i>The Poker House</i> won an Outstanding Performance award from the Los Angeles Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence\'s breakthrough role came in the small-scale drama <i>Winter\'s Bone</i> (2010), based on Daniel Woodrell\'s novel of the same name. In Debra Granik\'s independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began to live with the family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood. David Denby of <i>The New Yorker</i> said the film \"would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic\", and Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote that \"her performance is more than acting, it\'s a gathering storm. Lawrence\'s eyes are a roadmap to what\'s tearing Ree apart.\" The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The actress was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance, and with her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, she became the second youngest person to be nominated in the category.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Lawrence took on a supporting role in <i>Like Crazy</i>, a romantic drama about long-distance relationships, starring Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones. Kenneth Turan of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> considered the film to be an \"intensely wrought and immensely satisfying love story\" and credited all three performers for \"making their [characters\'] yearning palpable\". She then appeared in Jodie Foster\'s black comedy <i>The Beaver</i> alongside Foster and Mel Gibson. Filmed in 2009, the production was delayed due to controversy concerning Gibson, and earned less than half of its $21 million budget.</p>\r\n<p>After her dramatic role in <i>Winter\'s Bone</i>, Lawrence looked for something less serious, and found it with her first high-profile release-Matthew Vaughn\'s superhero film <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011)-a prequel to the <i>X-Men</i> film series. She portrayed the shapeshifting mutant Mystique, a role played by Rebecca Romijn in the earlier films. Vaughn cast Lawrence, as he thought that she would be able to portray the weakness and strength involved in the character\'s transformation. For the part, Lawrence lost weight and practiced yoga. For Mystique\'s blue form, she had to undergo eight hours of makeup, as Romijn had done on the other films. She was intimidated in the role as she admired Romijn. Writing for <i>USA Today</i>, Claudia Puig considered the film to be a \"classy re-boot\" of the film series, and believed that her \"high-spirited performance\" empowered the film. With worldwide earnings of $350 million, <i>X-Men: First Class</i> became Lawrence\'s highest-grossing film at that point.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012 she played Katniss Everdeen in <i>The Hunger Games</i>, an adaptation of the first book in author Suzanne Collins\' <i>Hunger Games</i> trilogy. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the series tells the story of the teenage heroine Everdeen as she joins rebel forces against a totalitarian government after winning a brutal televised annual event. Despite being an admirer of the books, Lawrence was initially hesitant to accept the part, because of the grand scale of the film. She agreed to the project after her mother convinced her to take the part. She practiced yoga, archery, rock and tree climbing, and hand-to-hand combat techniques for the role. While training for the part, she injured herself running into a wall. The film received generally positive reviews, and Lawrence\'s portrayal of Everdeen was particularly praised. Todd McCarthy of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> called her an \"ideal screen actress\", adding that she embodies the Everdeen of the novel, and believed that she anchored the film \"with impressive gravity and presence\". Roger Ebert agreed that she was \"strong and convincing in the central role\". With worldwide revenues of over $690 million, <i>The Hunger Games</i> became a top-grossing film featuring a female lead, making Lawrence the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. The success of the film established her as a star.</p>\r\n<p>Later in 2012, Lawrence played a young depressed widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell\'s romance movie <i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>. The film was an adaptation of Matthew Quick\'s novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was drawn to her character\'s complex personality: \"She didn\'t really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn\'t\". While Russell initially considered Lawrence to be too young for the part, she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. The actress found herself challenged by Russell\'s spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the \"best experience of my life\". Richard Corliss of <i>Time</i> wrote: \"Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who <i>is</i>, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role.\" Peter Travers believed that Lawrence \"is some kind of miracle. She\'s rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes all in the same scene, even in the same breath.\" She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, becoming-at age 22-the second youngest Best Actress winner. Her final film of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai\'s critically panned thriller <i>House at the End of the Street</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2013, Lawrence hosted an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, with musical guest The Lumineers. <i>The Devil You Know</i>, a small-scale production that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, was her first release of 2013. She then reprised the role of Everdeen in <i>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</i>, the second installment in the <i>Hunger Games</i> film series. While performing the film\'s underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection that resulted in a brief loss of hearing. With box office earnings of $865 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release. Stephanie Zacharek of <i>The Village Voice</i> believed that Lawrence\'s portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal role model, and wrote that \"there\'s no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her\". She took on a supporting role in Russell\'s ensemble crime drama <i>American Hustle</i> (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by Christian Bale). Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\'s Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen. Geoffrey Macnab of <i>The Independent</i> praised her as \"funny and acerbic\", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband\'s mistress (played by Amy Adams) on the lips. Lawrence\'s performance won her the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third Academy Award nomination, her first in the supporting category.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence played Serena Pemberton in Susanne Bier\'s depression-era drama <i>Serena</i> (2014), based on the novel of the same name by Ron Rash. In the film, she and her husband George (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) are a married couple who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The project was filmed in 2012, and was released in 2014 to poor reviews. Lawrence then reprised the role of Mystique in <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i>, which served as a sequel to both <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> (2006) and <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011). The film received positive reviews and grossed $748.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series to that point. Justin Chang of Variety praised her look in the film but thought that she had little to do but \"glower, snarl and let the f/x artists do their thing\". Lawrence\'s next two releases were in the final parts of <i>The Hunger Games</i> film series, <i>Mockingjay - Part 1</i> (2014) and <i>Part 2</i> (2015). For the musical score of the former film, she sang the song \"The Hanging Tree\", which charted on multiple international singles charts. In a review of the final film in the series, Manohla Dargis of <i>The New York Times</i> drew similarities between her rise to stardom and Everdeen\'s journey as a rebel leader, writing: \"Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing, partly because, like all great stars, she seems to be playing a version of her \'real\' self\". Both films earned more than $650 million worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence worked with Russell for the third time in the biopic <i>Joy</i> (2015), in which she plays the eponymous character, a troubled single mother who becomes a successful businessperson after inventing the Miracle Mop. During production in Boston, the press reported on a disagreement between Russell and Lawrence that resulted in a \"screaming match\". She said that her friendship with Russell made it easier for them to disagree, because people fight when they really love each other. The film was not as well received as their previous collaborations, but her performance was praised. Richard Roeper called it \"a wonderfully layered performance that carries the film through its rough spots and sometime dubious detours\" that was her best since <i>Winter\'s Bone</i>. She won a third Golden Globe Award, and was nominated for another Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the youngest person to accrue four Oscar nominations. Lawrence began 2016 by providing the narration for <i>A Beautiful Planet</i>, a documentary film that explores Earth from the International Space Station. She played Mystique for the third time in <i>X-Men: Apocalypse</i> (2016). The film received mixed reviews, with a consensus that it was overfilled with action that detracted from the story\'s themes and cast\'s performances. Helen O\'Hara from <i>Empire</i> considered the film to be a letdown from the previous installments of the series, and criticized the actress for making her character too grim. Despite this, she was rewarded Favorite Movie Actress at the 43rd People\'s Choice Awards.</p>\r\n<p>Lawrence was paid $20 million for playing Aurora Lane in the science fiction film <i>Passengers</i> (2016), and she received top-billing over co-star Chris Pratt. It features Pratt and her as two people who wake up 90 years too soon from an induced hibernation on a spaceship bound for a new planet. Lawrence says that she felt nervous performing her first sex scene and kissing a married man (Pratt) on screen; she drank alcohol to prepare herself for filming. Critical reaction was mixed, but Lawrence defended the film by calling it a \"tainted, complicated love story\". Darren Aronofsky\'s psychological horror film <i>Mother!</i> was Lawrence\'s sole release of 2017. She starred as a young wife who experiences trauma when her home is invaded by unexpected guests. Lawrence spent three months rehearsing the film in a warehouse in Brooklyn, despite her reluctance to rehearsals in her previous assignments. The intense role proved difficult for her to film; she was put on supplemental oxygen when she hyperventilated one day, and she also dislocated a rib. <i>Mother!</i> polarized viewers and prompted mass walkouts. The film was better received by critics; Walter Addiego of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> labelled it \"assaultive\" and a \"deliberate test of audience endurance\", and credited Lawrence for \"never allow[ing] herself to be reduced simply to a howling victim\".</p>\r\n<p>The following year, Lawrence starred as Dominika Egorova, a Russian spy who makes contact with a mysterious CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton), in Francis Lawrence\'s espionage thriller <i>Red Sparrow</i>, based on Jason Matthews\' novel of the same name. She learned to speak in a Russian accent and undertook ballet training for four months. Lawrence was challenged by the sexuality in her role, but has said that performing the nude scenes made her feel empowered. IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn disliked the film\'s denouement, but praised the work of Lawrence and Charlotte Rampling, stating that \"the considerable talent on display is [the film\'s] constant saving grace.\" As of 2018, Lawrence\'s films have grossed over $5.7 billion worldwide.</p>', 'actors/jennifer-lawrence_Cover.jpg'),
(35, 'Jessica', '', 'Lange', 'F', '<p>The thirteenth actress in history to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting, winning two Academy Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, one Tony Award, one Screen Actors Guild Award and five Golden Globe Awards. Additionally, she is the second actress in history to win the Academy Award for Best Actress after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; the third actress and first performer since 1943 to receive two Oscar nominations within the same year; the fifth actress and ninth performer to win Oscars in both the lead and supporting acting categories; and is tied as the sixth most Oscar-nominated actress in history. She is the only performer ever to win Primetime Emmy Awards in both the supporting and lead acting categories for the same miniseries. Lange has also garnered one Critics Choice Award and three Dorian Awards, making her the most honored actress by the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association. In 1998, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> listed Lange among the 25 Greatest Actresses of the 1990s. In 2014, Lange was scheduled to receive a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it.</p>\r\n<p>Jessica Phyllis Lange was born in Cloquet, Minnesota, on April 20, 1949. Her father, Albert John Lange (1913-1989), was a teacher and traveling salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (née Sahlman; 1913-1998), was a housewife. Third of four children, she has two older sisters, Jane and Ann, and a younger brother named George. Her paternal ancestry originates in Germany and the Netherlands, while her maternal ancestry originates in Finland. Due to the nature of her father\'s professions, her family moved over a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling back down in her hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.</p>\r\n<p>In 1967, she received a scholarship to study art and photography at the University of Minnesota, where she met and began dating Spanish photographer Paco Grande. After the two married in 1971, Lange left college to pursue a more bohemian lifestyle, traveling in the United States and Mexico in a minivan with Grande. The couple then moved to Paris, where they drifted apart. While in Paris, Lange studied mime theatre under the supervision of Étienne Decroux, and joined the Opéra-Comique as a dancer. She later studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>While sharing an apartment with Jerry Hall and Grace Jones, she was discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and subsequently became a model for the Wilhelmina modelling agency. In 1973, she returned to the States and began work in New York City as a waitress at the Lion\'s Head Tavern in Greenwich Village. While modelling, Lange was discovered by Hollywood producer Dino De Laurentiis, who was looking to cast his next leading lady, an ingenue for his remake of the 1933 <i>King Kong</i>. Despite being a box-office success - it became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 - and receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the film and her performance were widely panned. However, renowned film critic Pauline Kael praised her, noting, \"The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange\'s fast yet dreamy comic style. [She] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in <i>My Man Godfrey</i>, [and] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they\'re in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like her, the way people liked Lombard.\" Lange went on to win the 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She remained a favorite of Kael, who later wrote \"She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too.\"</p>\r\n<p>At the close of the decade, Bob Fosse, whom Lange had befriended and with whom she had carried on a casual romantic affair, cast Lange as the Angel of Death, a part that he had written specifically for her in his semiautobiographical film, <i>All That Jazz</i> (1979). She had also been considered for the role of Wendy Torrance in <i>The Shining</i> before that role ultimately went to Shelley Duvall.</p>\r\n<p>Lange began the new decade in the light romp <i>How to Beat the High Cost of Living</i> (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it received mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which he was working with Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for <i>Goin\' South</i> (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic <i>film noir</i>, <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i> (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.</p>\r\n<p>While editing <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, Graeme Clifford realized he had found the leading lady for his next film - his first as a director; a biographical film of actress Frances Farmer, whose disillusionment with Hollywood and chaotic family background led her down a tragic path. Filming <i>Frances</i> (1982), which co-starred Kim Stanley and Sam Shepard, was a grueling experience for Lange, who pored over the screenplay scene by scene, making deep and often taxing connections between her life and Farmer\'s to tap into the well of emotions the role required. By the end of the shoot, she was physically and mentally spent. Due to this, she decided to take her co-star Stanley\'s advice to star in \"something light\", which led her to accept a supporting role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack\'s <i>Tootsie</i> (1982).</p>\r\n<p>In 1982, Lange became the first performer in 40 years to receive two Academy Award nominations in the same year, scoring a nomination for her work in <i>Frances</i> and eventually winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in <i>Tootsie</i>, which not only became the second-highest-grossing film of 1982, following Steven Spielberg\'s <i>ET</i>, but which also scored an additional nine Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture. Her performance in the film also earned her a Golden Globe, along with awards from the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Lange also won Best Actress at the Moscow International Film Festival for her performance in <i>Frances</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Lange next produced and starred, again opposite Shepard, in 1984\'s <i>Country</i>, a topical film depicting a family during the farm crisis. Her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. That same year, she made her television debut as Maggie the Cat, starring opposite Tommy Lee Jones in a CBS <i>Playhouse</i> production of Tennessee Williams\'s <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>. The following year, she testified before the United States Congress on behalf of the Democratic House Task Force on Agriculture, alongside Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, whom she later neighbored and befriended.</p>\r\n<p>At the close of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz\'s biopic, <i>Sweet Dreams</i>, opposite Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second place for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In several interviews, Meryl Streep has stated that she \"begged\" Reisz, who directed her in 1981\'s <i>The French Lieutenant\'s Woman</i>, for the role of Cline, but that his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has also been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange\'s performance, calling her \"beyond wonderful\" in the film and stating, \"I couldn\'t imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did because she was so amazing in it.\" In 2018, Streep further commented, \"Jessica did it better than any human being could possibly have done it.\" Streep has also admitted, \"Every job I\'ve ever taken, about three weeks before I begin, I call up my agent and say, \'I don\'t think I can do this. I don\'t think I\'m right for it. They should call up Jessica Lange.\'\"</p>\r\n<p>Lange\'s films throughout the mid- to late 1980s, which included <i>Crimes of the Heart</i> (1986), <i>Far North</i> (1988), and <i>Everybody\'s All-American</i> (1989). In 1989, she starred in Costa-Gavras\' <i>Music Box</i> Lange played a Hungarian lawyer defending her father of Nazi war crimes. Her performance earned her a fifth Academy Award nomination and a sixth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>Lange continued making films throughout the 1990s, periodically taking time off to raise her children and also choosing theater- and television-based projects. She began the decade in Paul Brickman\'s warmly received <i>Men Don\'t Leave</i> (1990), for which she earned positive reviews and came in third place for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. She was then approached by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who had both auditioned her for the role of Jake LaMotta\'s wife in <i>Raging Bull</i> (1981), to star in a remake of <i>Cape Fear</i> (1991). The film became the 12th-highest-grossing film of the year. In 1992, Lange once again starred opposite Robert De Niro in Irwin Winkler\'s <i>Night and the City</i> and also starred in a television adaptation of Willa Cather\'s <i>O Pioneers!</i>, receiving her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.</p>\r\n<p>In 1994, Lange was lauded for her performance as a manic depressive army wife in the 1960s in Tony Richardson\'s final film, <i>Blue Sky</i>. In 1995, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the Utah Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Actress. She also came in second place for the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. She became the second actress in history, after Meryl Streep, to follow up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar win with a Best Actress Oscar win, an achievement not repeated until nearly twenty years later by Cate Blanchett.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995, she followed her victory with further critically lauded performances in <i>Losing Isaiah</i>, opposite Halle Berry, and <i>Rob Roy</i>, with Liam Neeson. That same year, Lange reprised her role as Blanche DuBois in a CBS television adaptation of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, opposite Alec Baldwin, Diane Lane, and John Goodman. She received glowing reviews for her performance, which earned her fourth Golden Globe Award and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.</p>\r\n<p>In 1996, Lange made her London stage debut in another performance as Blanche DuBois, which received rave reviews. The following year, she starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a film adaptation of Jane Smiley\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, <i>A Thousand Acres</i>. Lange received her ninth Golden Globe Award nomination and won the Venice Film Festival\'s Schermi d\'Amore award for her performance in the film. In 1998, she starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in a film adaptation of Balzac\'s <i>Cousin Bette</i>, for which she received strong reviews. That same year, Lange also starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in the somewhat cult classic, <i>Hush</i>, which generally received negative reviews. Roger Ebert, however, praised Lange\'s performance, commenting, \"The film\'s most intriguing element is the performance by Jessica Lange, who by not going over the top provides Martha with a little pathos to leaven the psychopathology.\"</p>\r\n<p>Lange received strong reviews for her performance in <i>Titus</i>, Julie Taymor\'s 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare\'s <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. Film critic for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Lisa Schwarzbaum, included Lange in a \"for your consideration\" article directed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She commented, \"Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words \'Academy Awards\' should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in <i>Titus</i> as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare for the first time as if nothing could be more fun, Lange steals the show - and when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that\'s grand theft.\"</p>\r\n<p>She appeared mostly in supporting roles thereafter, most notably opposite Christina Ricci in the 2001 adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel\'s best-selling memoir on depression, <i>Prozac Nation</i>. In 2003, Lange starred opposite Tom Wilkinson in HBO\'s <i>Normal</i>, a film about a man who reveals to his wife his decision to have a sex change, for which she received nominations for the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She followed this with performances in the Bob Dylan vehicle, <i>Masked and Anonymous</i> (2003), Tim Burton\'s <i>Big Fish</i> (2003), Jim Jarmusch\'s <i>Broken Flowers</i> (2005) and Wim Wenders\' <i>Don\'t Come Knocking</i> (2005). She later starred with Tammy Blanchard in a remake of <i>Sybil</i> in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Lange co-starred as Big Edie, opposite Drew Barrymore, in HBO\'s <i>Grey Gardens</i>, directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The film was a huge success, garnering 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and winning five. Lange won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie after two previous nominations in the same category. She also received her eleventh Golden Globe Award nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance, losing both awards to Barrymore.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Lange joined the cast of FX\'s horror anthology series <i>American Horror Story</i>. Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk originally wrote her part as a supporting character, but after Lange acquired the role, they expanded it considerably. Murphy, a long-time admirer of Lange, stated that he chose her because he wanted to expose her work to a new generation of viewers. He also singled out her performance as Blanche DuBois on Broadway in 1992, which he saw twice, as his favorite performance, citing it as another motivating factor in hiring Lange. The show was a huge success not only for the network and creators, but also for Lange, who experienced a resurgence in her popularity, receiving rave reviews and several awards for her controversial role. She was chosen by <i>TV Guide</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, and <i>MTV</i> for giving one of the \"best performances of 2011\". In addition, she won a second Primetime Emmy Award, a fifth Golden Globe Award, and her first Screen Actors Guild Award, after two previous nominations. She was also awarded a Special Achievement Satellite Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series by the International Press Academy and the Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the <i>Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association</i> (GALECA). She was further nominated for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics\' Choice Television Award, and Saturn Award.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, she had a supporting role in her <i>Grey Gardens</i> director Michael Suscy\'s box-office hit <i>The Vow</i>, opposite Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, but also returned to star as the lead in the second season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, titled <i>American Horror Story: Asylum</i>. Once again, she was chosen by <i>TV Guide</i> and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> for giving one of the \"best performances of 2012\". She won a second Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the GALECA, and received a fifth Emmy nomination, a thirteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a second Saturn Award nomination, and a second Critics\' Choice Television Award nomination.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, the third season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>, garnered the series its highest ratings to that point, and has held the record for garnering the series its highest on-average ratings. Lange was joined by fellow film actors Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. For her work on the show, Lange earned a third Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries, a third Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year and her first Critic\'s Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. She also received her fourteenth Golden Globe nomination, her fifth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and her fifth Satellite Award nomination for her performance on the series. In addition, Lange replaced Glenn Close in a film adaptation of Émile Zola\'s <i>Thérèse Raquin</i>, directed by Charlie Stratton and titled <i>In Secret</i>, co-starring Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Felton, Oscar Isaac, and Matt Lucas for which she received rave reviews.</p>\r\n<p>Lange began 2014 by being honored with a nomination for a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it. Lange was also recognized by <i>Elle Magazine</i> with the L\'Oreal de Paris Legend Award presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during <i>The Women in Hollywood Awards</i>, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing. She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.</p>\r\n<p>Later in the year, Marc Jacobs chose Lange to be the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. In addition, Lange was featured in the brand\'s summer and fall print ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and starred in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs. Previously, Jacobs dressed and interviewed Lange for <i>Love</i> magazine\'s fifth-anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as the soundtrack for his autumn/winter 2014 show. She next starred opposite Mark Wahlberg in the remake of the 1970s action-thriller, <i>The Gambler</i>, receiving rave reviews for her work. She also led the fourth season of <i>American Horror Story</i>, titled <i>American Horror Story: Freak Show</i>. The series, once again, topped its and the network\'s highest ratings, breaking all ratings records for both. Though self-admittedly not a singer, Lange\'s covers of David Bowie\'s \"Life on Mars\" and Lana Del Rey\'s \"Gods and Monsters\" for the show were both hugely popular, receiving heavy circulation on YouTube and charting in the top 50 on the iTunes music charts. For her work on the show, Lange received her seventh Primetime Emmy Award nomination, her fifteenth Golden Globe nomination, and her fourth Critics\' Choice Television Award nomination.

(36, 'Jim', '', 'Parsons', 'M', '<p>Known for playing Sheldon Cooper in the CBS sitcom <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. He has received several awards for his performance, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy.</p>\r\n<p>James Joseph Parsons was born at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas, and was raised in one of its northern suburbs, Spring. He is the son of Milton Joseph \"Mickey/Jack\" Parsons, Jr. and teacher Judy Ann (née McKnight). His sister Julie Ann Parsons is also a teacher. After playing the role of the Kola-Kola bird in a school production of <i>The Elephant\'s Child</i> at age six, Parsons was determined to become an actor. He attended Klein Oak High School in Spring. Parsons points to a role in <i>Noises Off</i> during his junior year as the first time \"I fully connected with the role I was playing and started to truly understand what it meant to be honest on stage.\" The young Parsons was heavily influenced by sitcoms, particularly <i>Three\'s Company</i>, <i>Family Ties</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After graduating from high school, Parsons received a bachelor\'s degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was a founding member of Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, \"Jim is a very specific personality. He\'s thoroughly original, which is one reason he\'s been so successful. But we worried, \'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we\'re doing?\' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out.\" Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: \"school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things.\" Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons traced his family\'s history on TLC\'s <i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i> in September 2013 and discovered French heritage from his father\'s side. One of his ancestors was the French architect Louis-François Trouard (1729-1804).</p>\r\n<p>In New York, Parsons worked in Off-Broadway productions and made several television appearances. In a much-discussed 2003 Quiznos commercial, Parsons played a man who had been raised by wolves and continued to nurse from his wolf \"mother\". He had a recurring role on the television show <i>Judging Amy</i> and appeared on the television series <i>Ed</i>. Parsons also had minor roles in several movies, including <i>Garden State</i> and <i>School for Scoundrels</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons has estimated that he auditioned for between 15 and 30 television pilots, but on many of the occasions when he was cast, the show failed to find a television network willing to purchase it. The exception came with <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers \"brilliantly use those words that most of us don\'t recognize to create that rhythm. And the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue, and in a lot of ways still is.\"</p>\r\n<p>In his audition, Mr. Parsons so impressed series creator Chuck Lorre that Lorre insisted on a second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends and the waitress who lives across the hall. The role requires Parsons to \"rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows.\" Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon\'s lines.</p>\r\n<p>Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons\'s physical comedy to that of Buster Keaton and other silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons\' instincts, saying that \"You can\'t teach that.\" Lorre describes Parsons\' \"great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as \'inspired\'.\" Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons\' performance as \"so spot-on, it seems as if the character and the actor are the same person.\" Parsons admits that the work is \"more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take. And that\'s really the fun of it.\"</p>\r\n<p>In August 2009, Parsons won the Television Critics Association award for individual achievement in comedy, beating Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Steve Carell, and Neil Patrick Harris. Parsons was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, winning in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014. In September 2010, Parsons and co-stars Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco signed new contracts, guaranteeing each of them $200,000 per episode for the fourth season of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, with substantial raises for each of the next three seasons. The three were also promised a percentage of the show\'s earnings. In January 2011, Parsons won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series - Comedy (the award was presented by co-star Cuoco). From August 2013, Parsons, Cuoco and Galecki each earned $325,000 per episode. In August 2014, Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco once again signed new contracts, guaranteeing each of them $1,000,000 per episode for the eighth, ninth, and tenth seasons of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, as well as quadrupling their percentage of the show\'s earnings to over 1% each.</p>\r\n<p>In August 2018, Parsons announced his refusal of a contract worth $50 million for seasons 13 and 14. The producers simultaneously announced that, after 279 episodes, the most of any multi-camera series in TV history, the show will come to an \"epic, creative close\" in May 2019. Parsons is expected to remain in his role as narrator of the prequel series, <i>Young Sheldon</i>.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Parsons appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Steve Martin, and Rashida Jones in the comedy film <i>The Big Year</i>. It was released in October. That same year, he appeared as the human alter ego of Walter, the newest Muppet introduced in <i>The Muppets</i>. On May 18, 2012, Parsons began appearing on Broadway as Elwood P. Dowd in a revival of <i>Harvey</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Parsons received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 11, 2015. He voiced Oh, one of the lead roles in the DreamWorks Animation comedy film <i>Home</i> (2015), alongside Rihanna. On January 29, 2015, it was announced that Parsons would star as God in the Broadway production of <i>An Act of God</i>, a new play by David Javerbaum and directed by Joe Mantello. The play began previews at Studio 54 on May 5, 2015 and closed August 2, 2015, to positive reviews.</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, Parsons started hosting his own SiriusXM talk show, <i>Jim Parsons Is Too Stupid for Politics</i>. The show ran for six weeks.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, Parsons was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook <i>A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo</i>.</p>', 'actors/jim-parsons_Cover.jpg'),

His father, Donald David Cryer (born 1936), is an actor and singer who originally studied to be a minister. Cryer\'s paternal grandfather, the Rev. Donald W. Cryer (1909-1988), was a well-known Methodist minister. He has two sisters, Robin and Shelly.</p>\r\n<p>When Cryer was twelve years old, he decided that he wanted to become an actor. When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked: \"Plumbing is a pretty good career.\" Cryer attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager, and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin. To his mother\'s \"great disappointment\", Cryer skipped college and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, United Kingdom for a summer short course in Shakespeare.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Cryer\'s first professional acting effort was as David in the Broadway play <i>Torch Song Trilogy</i>, replacing Matthew Broderick, whom he \"closely resembled\". Cryer was later an understudy and replacement for Broderick in Neil Simon\'s <i>Brighton Beach Memoirs</i> in 1989.</p>\r\n<p>At age 19, Cryer appeared in the 1984 romantic comedy film <i>No Small Affair</i>, in the lead role as Charles Cummings, after the original production with Matthew Broderick was shut down due to a heart attack by director Martin Ritt. He went on to have small roles in films and television movies, and he made his breakthrough as Phil \"Duckie\" Dem(p)ster in the John Hughes-scripted film <i>Pretty in Pink</i>. In an interview with the <i>Daily News</i>, Cryer\'s mother said that after <i>Pretty in Pink</i>, she started getting calls from teenage girls from all over the world, who would leave hysterical, giggling messages on her answering machine. In 1989, he got the lead role in the TV comedy series <i>The Famous Teddy Z</i>. His performance gained poor reviews and the show was canceled after the first season.</p>\r\n<p>A year later, he starred with Charlie Sheen in the Jim Abrahams comedy <i>Hot Shots!</i>, which was received very positively. Cryer is frequently linked to the Brat Pack. In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for <i>St. Elmo\'s Fire</i> but was not cast in a role. In 1993, he was asked to audition for the role of Chandler Bing on <i>Friends</i>, while doing a play in London. His reading was videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995, he was cast as Bob in the sitcom <i>Partners</i>, which, like his prior show <i>The Famous Teddy Z</i>, was canceled after its first season.

Although the show was picked up for a second season after its abbreviated spring run, it was canceled that fall, after airing 17 episodes in total. In 2000, he was cast as the lead in a comedy series called <i>The Trouble With Normal</i>. For the third time, Cryer starred in a show which was canceled after its first season.</p>\r\n<p>Cryer\'s long run of unsuccessful TV projects finally ended three years later. Against the wishes of CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series <i>Two and a Half Men</i>. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show\'s high ratings, he said: \"When you\'re on a show that\'s fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, \'My instincts haven\'t worked so far.\' But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes a huge amount of pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before.\" After former co-star Charlie Sheen\'s departure from the series, Cryer\'s character became the show\'s main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show\'s retooled plot. At the end of the series of <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series; Sheen was fired in March 2011 and Cryer\'s on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after describing the show as \"filth\" and calling himself a \"paid hypocrite\". All appeared to be forgiven later, as Jones, unlike Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. Before being cast for <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel\'s reimagined <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, but the role went to James Callis.

He was then transported to America an indentured servant to work at the Saugus Iron Works at Lynn, Massachusetts. As part of his research for the episode, Cryer visited the site of the Battle of Dunbar, Durham Cathedral in Durham, North East England - where surviving Scottish prisoners were held until they were indentured - and the Saugus Iron Works national historic site. Cryer said: \"Seeing the resilience of my family over centuries, you can see the legacy he left. I can\'t help but feel lucky...clearly, the resilience of my family, that spine of steel, was not something that came from nowhere. Moving forward, I\'m going to take James Adams\' strength as my inspiration and know that when you go through very, very difficult times, if you can turn around and help the people around you who had it even worse, that\'s real strength. And I aspire to be one of those people.\"</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2018, it was announced that Cryer had been cast as Lex Luthor on The CW\'s <i>Supergirl</i> in a recurring role, starting in the fifteenth episode of Season 4.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2019, Cryer joined other WGA writers in firing their agents as part of the WGA\'s stand against the ATA and the unfair practice of packaging.</p>', 'jon-cryer_Cover.jpg'),

Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm enrolled at the University of Missouri. At Missouri he answered an advertisement from a theater company seeking players for a production of <i>A Midsummer Night\'s Dream</i>, auditioned, and was cast in the production. Other roles followed, such as Leon Czolgosz in <i>Assassins</i>.</p>\r\n<p>After graduating in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, Hamm returned to his high school to teach eighth-grade acting. One of his students was Ellie Kemper, who later became an actress and stars with him in the Netflix original television series, <i>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Not wishing to stay in a \"normal career\", Hamm relocated to Los Angeles permanently during 1995 with an automobile and $150. He relocated to a house with four other aspiring actors and began working as a waiter while attending auditions. He acted in theatre, including as Flavius in a production of Shakespeare\'s <i>Timon of Athens</i> with the Sacred Fools Theater Company. Looking older than his age, finding work as an actor was difficult, despite representation by the William Morris Agency. During 1998, having failed to obtain any acting jobs after three years, he was terminated as a client by William Morris.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm continued working as a waiter and, briefly, as a set designer for a softcore pornography movie. After repeatedly failing to get promising roles, Hamm set his 30th birthday as a deadline to succeed in Hollywood, stating:</p>\r\n<p>\"You either suck that up and find another agent, or you go home and say you gave it a shot, but that\'s the end of that. The last thing I wanted to be out here was one of those actors who\'s 45 years old, with a tenuous grasp of their own reality, and not really working much. So I gave myself five years. I said, if I can\'t get it going by the time I\'m 30, I\'m in the wrong place. And as soon as I said that, it\'s like I started working right away.</p>\r\n<p>During 2000, Hamm obtained the role of romantic firefighter Burt Ridley on NBC\'s drama series <i>Providence</i>. His one-episode contract grew to 19, and enabled him to quit waiting tables. Hamm made his feature movie debut with one line in Clint Eastwood\'s space adventure <i>Space Cowboys</i> (2000); more substantial roles followed in the independent comedy movie <i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i> (2001) and the war film <i>We Were Soldiers</i> (2002). During filming that movie, he turned 30. His career was bolstered by his playing the recurring role of police inspector Nate Basso on Lifetime\'s television series <i>The Division</i>, from 2002 to 2004. Other minor roles followed on the television series <i>What About Brian</i>, <i>CSI: Miami</i>, <i>Related</i>, <i>Numb3rs</i>, <i>The Unit</i>, and <i>The Sarah Silverman Program</i>. Hamm\'s <i>Mad Men</i> castmate Eric Ladin had said that one of the reasons he admires Hamm is that while he \"made it\" later than most actors, Hamm never gave up on acting.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm landed his breakthrough role during 2007, when he was cast from more than 80 candidates as the protagonist character Don Draper, in AMC\'s drama series <i>Mad Men</i>. In the series, set in a fictional 1960s advertising agency, he plays a suave, married advertising executive with an obscure past. He recalled, \"I read the script for <i>Mad Men</i> and I loved it. [...] I never thought they\'d cast me-- I mean, I thought they\'d go with one of the five guys who look like me but are movie stars\". He believes that an actor with a \"proven track record\" would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and <i>Mad Men</i> creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, \"it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part\". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper\'s backstory. Hamm says that he used memories of his father to portray Draper, a well-dressed, influential man of business and society hiding great inner turmoil and experiencing changes in the world beyond his control.</p>\r\n<p><i>Mad Men</i> debuted on July 19, 2007, with almost 1.4 million viewers. It developed a loyal audience, with Hamm receiving strong reviews. Robert Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> was complimentary of Hamm\'s performance, describing the actor\'s interpretation of Draper as a \"starmaking performance\". <i>The Boston Globe</i>\'s Matthew Gilbert termed Hamm a \"brilliant lead\".</p>\r\n<p>For his work, Hamm won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series - Drama during 2008. Also during 2008, he was nominated for both the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. During 2009, Hamm was again nominated for the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same category, and received another Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. During 2010, Mr. Hamm received his third Golden Globe Award nomination. <i>Mad Men</i> concluded its seven-season run on May 17, 2015. Hamm received his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series on September 20, 2015 after receiving 12 Emmy nominations for acting for and producing the series.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm\'s next film role was for the 2008 science fiction movie <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>, a remake of the 1951 film of the same name. Although the movie received mixed reviews, it was successful financially, earning $230 million worldwide. Hamm hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, season 34, episode 6, on October 25, 2008, and played various roles, including Don Draper in two sketches. He returned as host again on January 30 and October 30, 2010. During 2009, Hamm guest-featured in three episodes of the NBC television situation comedy show <i>30 Rock</i>, as Drew Baird, a doctor who is a neighbor and love interest of Liz Lemon\'s (Tina Fey). For these performances, he received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm\'s first leading film role came with the independent mystery thriller <i>Stolen</i> in 2009, in which he played a police officer whose son has been missing for eight years. Hamm had a minor voice role in the animated feature <i>Shrek Forever After</i>-released during May 2010-, as an ogre leader named Brogan. Also that year, he appeared as an FBI agent in the movie <i>The Town</i> (2010), with Ben Affleck. After having received \"about 40 scripts that were all set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys\", Hamm was pleased that the movie offered a role \"the opposite to Don Draper\". The feature received generally favorable reviews and earned $144 million worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>His next acting role was as defense attorney Jake Ehrlich in the independent film <i>Howl</i>, based on Allen Ginsberg\'s eponymous 1956 poem. On December 12, 2010, Hamm made a guest appearance as an FBI supervisor on Fox\'s animated series <i>The Simpsons</i>. He featured in Zack Snyder\'s action-fantasy film <i>Sucker Punch</i> (2011), as the character High Roller, and the doctor. He also had a supporting role in the comedy <i>Bridesmaids</i> as Kristen Wiig\'s \"rude and arrogant sex buddy\". Hamm was next seen in the independent feature <i>Friends with Kids</i> (2011), which he produced alongside his then-partner Jennifer Westfeldt. The story concerns a group of friends whose lives are changed as the couples in the group begin to have children.</p>\r\n<p>He had a recurring role in the situation comedy <i>The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret</i> in 2012, as the servant of socio-pathic billionaire Dave Mountford (Blake Harrison). Hamm hosted the 21st ESPYS Awards on July 17, 2013. The next year, he played sports agent J.B. Bernstein in Disney\'s sports drama <i>Million Dollar Arm</i> (2014). He co-featured with Daniel Radcliffe in <i>A Young Doctor\'s Notebook</i>, playing an older version of Radcliffe\'s character, from December 2012 to December 2013. In December 2014, Hamm guest starred in a special Christmas episode of the British science fiction anthology series <i>Black Mirror</i>, titled \"White Christmas\". He had a number of roles during 2015, in the comedy shows <i>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i> and <i>Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp</i>. He was featured in the animated comedy <i>Minions</i>, as the voice of Herb Overkill. <i>Minions</i> was a major box office success; despite mixed reviews, it grossed a total of over $1 billion worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Hamm featured in the comedy <i>Keeping Up with the Joneses</i>, alongside Zach Galifianakis and Gal Gadot; the film was filmed during the spring of 2015, and was released during October 2016 after being delayed seven months. He appeared in the science fiction film <i>Marjorie Prime</i>, which premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Edgar Wright\'s comedy crime film <i>Baby Driver</i>, which premiered at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival, and the drama <i>Aardvark</i>, which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival. In 2018, Hamm appeared in the drama <i>Nostalgia</i> and the political thriller <i>Beirut</i>. Hamm appeared in the <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> episode \"Goodbye, Krabby Patty?\".</p>\r\n<p>In 2017 Hamm joined the BBC and Amazon\'s television adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\'s <i>Good Omens</i> as the Archangel Gabriel.</p>', 'actors/jon-hamm_Cover.jpg');

// This file would send the user a temporary password to their email to use to log in if they are registered in the system.

// Including the configuration file which would use some of the variables and the error management:
require('includes/config.inc.php');

// Naming the proper page title:
$page_title = 'Forgot Password';

// Include the header file:
include('includes/header.html');
